<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>These chapters are not intended to form a whole by
themselves. They are merely an enlarged version of a
course of lectures in which European Political Institutions in
general were treated historically and comparatively: and as I
wish hereafter to make similar enlarged versions of the other
parts of the course and to append them to what I have here
written, I hope that these chapters on the Greek Institutions
may prove to be only a first instalment of a book on Comparative
Politics. The following pages contain what their title
indicates, a description and examination of Greek governments:
but in view of the additions which may probably be made to
them, they also contain a small amount of matter which is
necessary as a preliminary to an examination of European
governments in general.</p>

<p>The attention which I have paid to method and definitions
of terms might lead my readers to suppose that I
conceive Comparative Politics to be a science. It is only fair
to them to express the opinions that I have formed on the
matter. I do think that the part of the comparative study
of Politics, which deals with barbaric and more particularly
with non-European peoples and their governments, has been
placed on a scientific footing by Mr Herbert Spencer in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
<cite>Political Institutions</cite>, though he has attained this great result
by a method which is not purely comparative, and which,
as it takes no heed of historical sequence of events, has
not stood him in good stead where he treats of historical
European communities and their constitutions. The part&mdash;the
most interesting and important part&mdash;of the study,
that which is concerned with civilised peoples and governments,
seems to me not yet to be science. It does indeed
enable us to lay down empirical rules, or rules founded solely on
observation, about peoples and governments, just as the study
of a language enables a grammarian to lay down empirical rules
about words and sentences. And further, among the rules
which have been laid down, there are some, (their number is, I
believe, very small,) which seem to be distinguished from the
rest in two respects, firstly because they are not subject to any
known exception, and secondly because some of the causes
which lie at the root of them have been discovered: and these
rules have something of the character of scientific laws, or
rules which are true, not only in all known instances, but
universally. But, on the other hand, most of the rules which
have as yet been laid down are of a different sort, and, either
because they are vague and indefinite, or because they are
subject to many exceptions, or for other like reasons, nothing
of the nature of a scientific law has been founded on them.</p>

<p>It is however common to all studies to be imperfect and only
half conclusive while they are in their infancy: many studies,
especially among those which are based on comparisons, have
before now progressed within the lapse of a few generations
from a very lowly condition to the status of complete
inductive sciences: and it is hard to see why the same good
fortune should not at some future time fall to the lot of
Comparative Politics.</p>

<p>The classification of European political bodies, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
given in my second chapter, was suggested to me in its main
outlines by a lecture which I heard delivered in Cambridge
many years ago by my friend Sir John Seeley: the usefulness
of some such classification was made clear to me some years
later but yet long ago by a course of lectures which was given
by another friend Professor Henry Sidgwick: and I have constructed
the classification as it stands in the second chapter
with the intention of making it serve as a framework both for
what I have here written about the Greeks and their governments
and for what I hope to write hereafter about other
European peoples and governments. To both the gentlemen
whom I have named I desire to express my hearty thanks for
the help and guidance that their lectures have given me in
my attempts to study Politics methodically.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<p class="ph">THE ARYAN RACES.</p>


<p>It is proved by similarities in the languages of the European
peoples and the Hindus and the Persians that they had in
some sense a common origin. It is not indeed probable that
they are sprung from the same parents: but their ancestors
once formed a group of closely associated peoples who lived
beside one another as neighbours and used either the same
language or dialects of the same language. The peoples which
had in this sense a common origin comprise all those that
belong to the stocks of the Hindus, the Persians, the Celts, the
Greeks, the Italians, the Teutons and the Slavs, and are known
collectively as the Aryans or as the Indo-European peoples.</p>

<p>The evidence of language not only proves that the Aryans
lived together as neighbours, but also tells us something about
their pursuits and habits. From the languages of the Greeks,
the Romans, the Germans and the ancient Hindus we learn
that the forefathers of these peoples before they left their
common dwelling-place were acquainted with the most important
domestic animals and had a name for each of them: for the
words <em>cow</em>, German <i lang="ger">Kuh</i>, Sanskrit <i lang="san">gâus</i>, Greek <i lang="grc">βοῦς</i>, Latin <i lang="la">bos</i>,
are mere variations from an Aryan word whose meaning they
retain unaltered: the same is true of the word <em>ewe</em>, Sanskrit
<i lang="san">avis</i>, Greek <i lang="grc">ὄϊς</i>, Latin <i lang="la">ovis</i>; of <em>goose</em>, German <i lang="ger">Gans</i>, Sanskrit
<i lang="san">hansas</i>, Greek <i lang="grc">χήν</i>, Latin <i lang="la">anser</i>; of <em>sow</em>, German <i lang="ger">Sau</i>, Sanskrit
<i lang="san">sû</i>, Greek <i lang="grc">σύς</i> or <i lang="grc">ὕς</i>, Latin <i lang="la">sus</i>; of <em>hound</em>, German <i lang="ger">Hund</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
Sanskrit <i lang="san">çvan</i>, Greek <i lang="grc">κύων</i>, Latin <i lang="la">canis</i>; and of Sanskrit
<i lang="san">açvas</i>, Greek <i lang="grc">ἵππος</i>, Latin <i lang="la">equus</i>, Saxon <i lang="nds">eoh</i> or <i lang="nds">ehu</i>.</p>

<p>In like manner the words <em>door</em>, German <i lang="ger">Thüre</i>, Sanskrit
<i lang="san">dvaras</i>, Greek <i lang="grc">θύρα</i>, Latin <i lang="la">fores</i>, prove that the Aryans used a
word bearing the same meaning and therefore their dwellings
were something more than mere tents or moveable huts. <em>Yoke</em>,
German <i lang="ger">Joch</i>, Sanskrit <i lang="san">jugam</i>, Greek <i lang="grc">ξυγόν</i>, Latin <i lang="la">jugum</i>, prove
that they employed cattle for draught; <i lang="grc">ἄξων</i>, Latin <i lang="la">axis</i>,
Sanskrit <i lang="san">akshas</i> (axle and cart), Old High German <i lang="goh">ahsa</i> (axle)
indicate the use of carts; the Sanskrit <i lang="san">nâus</i>, Greek <i lang="grc">ναῦς</i>,
Latin <i lang="la">navis</i>, German <i lang="ger">Nachen</i>, show that they could make
boats: the Sanskrit <i lang="san">aritram</i> (an oar or paddle<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>), Greek <i lang="grc">ἐρετμός</i>,
Latin <i lang="la">remus</i> (<i lang="la">resmus</i>), prove that they propelled them by
rowing or paddling. The absence however of common words
for a mast, a sail, the sea, indicate that the waters that they
knew were rivers or small lakes and that they did not possess
the art of getting propulsion from the wind<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>.</p>

<p>The Aryans were not entirely ignorant of plants that
produce corn: for there was an Aryan word from which are
descended the Sanskrit <i lang="san">yavas</i> (barley), the Greek <i lang="grc">ζειά</i> (spelt, a
kind of grain) and <i lang="ave">jáva</i> in Zend (or Old Persian), Slavic and
Lithuanian. Mommsen, noticing only the Sanskrit and the
Greek, and observing the difference of meaning, thinks that
the Aryans while they were all together merely gathered and
ate the grains of barley and spelt that grew wild. A recent
English writer points out the wide diffusion of the words
descended from the Aryan word, and thinks it could not have
left traces of its existence in so many languages unless corn
had been cultivated by the Aryans and had thus become
well known to them<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>. This inference seems to be fair: but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
the absence of traces of other original Aryan words for
agricultural products or instruments shows clearly that agriculture
played only a subordinate part in their economy. It is
probable that they sowed some kind of grain in little plots
of ground that scarcely needed tillage.</p>

<p>The results of the evidence which has been adduced may be
summed up by saying that the forefathers of the Greeks,
Romans, Germans and Hindus, while they still occupied their
common Aryan home, lived not in tents but in houses with
doors, and were therefore not mere wanderers but had more
or less permanent abodes: they were not savages dependent on
wild animals and wild fruits for subsistence, but had sheep and
cattle to supply them with flesh and milk: they had carts on
wheels and knew how to yoke their oxen and horses: they made
boats and propelled them on their rivers or lakes with oars
or paddles: and they were acquainted with some kinds
of grain, but were either ignorant of agriculture or cared
little for it.</p>

<p>From the condition in which the Aryans lived we may
safely infer that they were not totally devoid of political
institutions. All men live under government except a few to
whom government is either impossible or useless. The multitude
of uncivilised races who inhabit or have inhabited the
earth may be divided into two great classes; the first and
lower class consisting of those who depend for subsistence solely
on wild plants and wild animals, the second and upper class
comprising all those who, in addition to the wild fruits that
they may gather and the wild animals that they may kill, also
have tame cattle to supply them with flesh and milk or
cultivated plants that produce grain. The lower class are
known either as savages or as hunting peoples: the upper, for
want of a better name, may be designated as barbarians. In
the lower class, the savages and hunting peoples, a very small
number of peoples are found who have been prevented by
specially adverse circumstances from having any governments:
but in the rest of the lower class and in all the upper class of
uncivilised peoples the existence of some kind of government is
universal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>In illustration and proof of these statements some facts may
be cited. The Bushmen of South Africa were at the beginning
of the present century a race of savages who wandered over an
arid sloping plain that lies to the South of the Orange River.
They just contrived to maintain a miserable existence on the
roots that they could grub up and on the flesh of animals that
they shot with poisoned arrows or entrapped in pitfalls: but, as
every family was compelled to keep itself isolated from all
neighbours in order to have enough to eat, government was
impossible. Other races resembling the Bushmen in the isolation
of their families and in having no government are the
Rock Veddahs in Ceylon and the Digger Indians in California.
A slightly different case occurs in the regions near the North Pole.
The Esquimaux, who live by catching seals and other marine
animals, are not precluded from grouping their huts in small
clusters: but nature offers so little reward to any combined
effort of a large number of men that they have never cared to
form political communities: and they afford perhaps the only
example of human beings living as neighbours but without
government. Leaving these very exceptional cases, we next
observe a group of hunting peoples with whom nature dealt
less unkindly. Some forty years ago, almost the only inhabitants
of the western part of British North America, now
known as Manitoba, were a number of Red Indian tribes who
supported themselves entirely by the chase, killing buffalo for
food and other animals for their furs, which they passed on to
traders in return for such commodities as the traders brought
them. During the greater part of the year each Red Indian
family wandered almost as much apart from communication
with mankind as did the Bushmen, for so the wild animals
could most advantageously be pursued: and of course while
they remained in dispersion had no government. But at
certain seasons in every year a whole tribe came together for
a great buffalo hunt: at other times they assembled to organize
a war against some neighbouring tribe: and whenever they
met for either purpose they subjected themselves to an efficient
government, which included even a system of police. Apart
from the groups of peoples whom I have mentioned, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
great number of savage peoples seems to have been observed
in recent times: the New Zealanders when first the
Europeans went among them were savages and cannibals,
and yet they lived under well established kingly governments.</p>

<p>With regard to the upper class of uncivilised peoples, the
barbarians, who either keep cattle or grow corn or do both, it
will suffice to say that observation of all of them (and they are
extremely numerous) proves that all of them have governments.
Nor is the fact hard to understand: for in their case it is never
necessary for single families to live in isolation: they do as a
matter of fact live collected together in groups of families, and
each group gains numberless advantages by living together and
acting together: and, where men live together and act together,
government naturally comes into existence. Those of the
barbarian peoples who, like the Aryans, have more or less fixed
abodes, always group themselves in small independent tribes
and adopt such simple forms of government as are suited to
their circumstances. There are many different kinds of tribal
governments. In nearly all of them a small number of men
distinguished for prowess daring or intelligence have some
authority over the rest: sometimes above these chiefs there is
a higher chief or king: and sometimes the whole body of
warriors may be called together to hear what the chiefs have to
say to them. Among the ancient Aryans all the governments
were no doubt tribal governments: but it is impossible to say
that any one of the various kinds of tribal governments prevailed
to the exclusion of the rest<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>
<p>When the Aryans had made such progress as I have
described they divided into two groups: one group contained
the forefathers of the Europeans, the other the forefathers of
the Hindus and Persians. Whether the separation arose through
a migration of only the Europeans or of only the Asiatics or
from migrations of both Europeans and Asiatics cannot be
determined. It is certain however that after the division of
the stocks took place the Europeans still remained together
long enough to acquire in common the art of ploughing. The
English word to <em>ear</em>, Anglo-Saxon <i lang="ang">erian</i>, Gothic <i lang="got">erjan</i>, Old High
German <i lang="goh">eren</i>, Latin <i lang="la">arare</i>, Greek <i lang="gre">ἀρόειν</i>, Irish <i lang="gle">araim</i> (I plough)
are mere variations of a single word and show that when
ploughing was introduced the European stocks were still in
close neighbourhood with one another and all adopted dialectic
varieties of the same sound to indicate the new method of
breaking up the soil<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>.</p>

<p>The region in which the forefathers of the Europeans lived
together cannot be precisely ascertained: the hypothesis that
it was in central Europe seems to fit in best with the geographical
distribution of their descendants and the relationships
between their languages.</p>

<p>The invention of the art of ploughing opened new possibilities
for the European peoples: for an agricultural people has
far better chances than a people of herdsmen of accumulating
wealth and making progress in the useful arts. But not all of
them cared to make use of the new art and to become tillers of
the soil. Those who took their homes amid the forests of
central Europe still continued the life of hunters and herdsmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
which had once been common to all the Aryans. Others devoted
themselves to agricultural pursuits with delight and success:
and among them were those who settled in the peninsulas of
Greece and Italy, where, favoured by many circumstances, they
made comparatively rapid progress in arts, knowledge and
political development.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="ph">A CLASSIFICATION OF EUROPEAN POLITICAL BODIES.</p>


<p>The subject matter of the study of politics consists firstly
of the groups or collections of men who have lived under
governments, and secondly of the governments under which
they have lived. In the present chapter I wish to speak of the
groups, to describe in outline the various forms which they
have taken, and to define the names by which their forms are
severally known. I must premise that I shall call some of the
groups political communities, meaning by a political community
a number of persons living under one government and also
having much else in common besides government: the rest I
shall call political aggregates, meaning by a political aggregate
a number of persons or bodies of persons living under one
government and having nothing else or very little else in
common. Having said this, I can proceed to notice the forms
of individual communities or aggregates, with a view to
classifying them according to their forms. In my survey the
earliest forms will be taken first, and the others afterwards, as
far as possible in chronological order<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>
<p>The two European races into whose past we can grope our
way farthest back are the Germans and the Greeks. Each of
these races, when first we have any knowledge of them, had
formed a large number of tribes or small primitive political
communities. The German tribes in the times of Cæsar and
of Tacitus and the Greek tribes in the time of Homer were
alike in being of small size and in being primitive in their
habits and government: but in a German tribe the whole
population lived scattered over the open country and there was
no walled city, while in a Greek tribe, though most of the
people lived in the open country, there was a walled city as a
centre for the community and a dwelling place for a few of the
most important tribesmen. It is desirable to give the word
<em>tribe</em> such a definition as will emphasize the distinction between
a tribe and a city, and I shall therefore define it as meaning a
small primitive political community, living in the open country
without any walled city. From this definition it follows that I
must regard the German tribes alone as being perfect specimens
of the genus tribe or as being tribes pure and simple: the early
Greek communities, though for brevity I shall speak of them as
tribes, ought in strict accuracy to be regarded as tribes which
were on the way to become cities and which had already
acquired some small portion of the qualities by which cities are
characterized.</p>

<p>In Greece tribes were succeeded by cities, that is to say
small communities in which a walled city is everything, and
the country districts are of little importance: and similar
communities arose also in Italy. The cities of ancient Greece
and Italy are often further designated as city-states, and the
name is rightly applied to them: for they were not only cities
in the sense which I have given to the word, but were also
states because each of them was an independent community
with a government of its own.</p>

<p>But the cities of ancient Greece and Italy were not all
alike: the Greek cities were inexpansive: in Italy one city
expanded itself by conquering a host of other cities and
absorbing their populations into its own body politic. The
contrast between the inexpansive cities of Greece and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
expansive city of Rome is a matter of which I hope some time
to speak at length: for the present it will suffice to notice that
the Athenians, the largest political community known to Greek
history in the age of the city states (that is to say before
338 <span class="small">B.C.</span>), inhabited a territory of less area than an average
English county: while in Italy before the beginning of the
second Punic war (218 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) towns or fortresses peopled by fully
qualified citizens of the Roman Republic were to be found
scattered over all the central region from Sena Gallica in
Umbria to Sinuessa in Campania, and other towns or fortresses
whose inhabitants possessed the private but not the public
rights of Roman citizens existed in all parts of the peninsula<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>.
It must however be observed that Rome did not by its
expansion lose the distinguishing characteristics of a city state:
it still continued after its expansion over all Italy to be a
community in which a single city was of supreme importance
and the population remote from the city was, politically at
least, of little moment: but as it was incomparably larger than
any ordinary city state, we must call it not simply a city state
but an enlarged or expanded city state.</p>

<p>The small size of the Greek cities and their incapacity for
acting in concert led to their subjugation by Macedonia in
338 <span class="small">B.C.</span> About sixty or eighty years later many of them had
recovered their independence, and some of them, in order to
guard against a second conquest by Macedonia, joined together
in a league or federation. The union of many communities
in a federation was not a new thing in Greek history: during
several centuries that preceded the year 338 <span class="small">B.C.</span> some obscure
tribes of mountaineers (the Achæans) had lived in such a
union; their league had been broken up by the Macedonian
conquerors, but they had been able, about 281 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, to reconstitute
it: and the Greek cities, when they began, about 251 <span class="small">B.C.</span>,
to see their need of mutual defence, had the Achæan League
ready at hand, and were able to gain what they needed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
enrolling themselves among its members. The Achæan League,
enlarged by the admission of many important cities, was a
federal state: that is to say, it was a community in which
each city or canton had a government of its own for most
purposes, but the federation or union of cities and cantons had
also a common government for those matters which most nearly
concerned the safety of them all. The League was perfectly
successful till 221 <span class="small">B.C.</span> in attaining the ends for which it had
been established, and is remarkable as furnishing the first
example in history of a well organized federal state<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>.</p>

<p>The Romans employed the strength, which they had
acquired through their conquest of Italy and their success in
the second Punic war, in getting possession of many distant
territories inhabited by alien races. Before 146 <span class="small">B.C.</span> they were
masters of Macedonia, part of Asia Minor, Spain and northern
Africa, and the Roman dominions presented an example of a
mere political aggregate, or heterogeneous empire or number of
peoples having no natural attraction for one another and held
together only by force. For the rule of a heterogeneous
empire the institutions of a city and even of an expanded city
proved utterly unsuitable: and it was necessary that both the
conquering city and the dominions which it had conquered
should submit to be ruled under a centralised and despotic
system of government adapted to the needs of a heterogeneous
empire. The right system was only gradually made, but it had
been completed by the death of the Emperor Constantine the
Great in 337 <span class="small">A.D.</span></p>

<p>But it is time to return to the Germans: for the Germans
were the successors of the Romans as masters of Western
Europe. The Germans in their primitive tribal condition
possessed a great aptitude for forming large political communities
by the union of many small communities:&mdash;an
aptitude which is probably common to all peoples in a tribal
condition:&mdash;and they inhabited a flat country which put no
obstacles in the way of the amalgamation of their tribes. At
any rate the German tribes between 150 <span class="small">A.D.</span> and 400 <span class="small">A.D.</span> were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
engaged in a process of amalgamation. About 150 <span class="small">A.D.</span> Ptolemy
enumerated more than fifty of them<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>: by the year 400 all or
nearly all of these had gathered themselves into a few great
hordes or associations of tribes, (which may themselves be
called overgrown tribes,) bearing severally the names of the
Saxons, the Salian Franks, the Ripuarian Franks, the Angli,
the Alamanni, the Burgundians, the Visigoths, the Ostrogoths,
the Lombards. After 400 <span class="small">A.D.</span> came the great migrations of
the German peoples: some of them invaded the provinces of
the Western Roman Empire, still full of wealth and of such
civilisation as the Romans had planted there: others, in the
second half of the fifth century, betook themselves to Britain,
from whence the Romans had departed in the year 407.</p>

<p>During the eleven centuries which intervened between the
migrations of the Germans and the year 1500, the Germans
who went to Britain, Spain and Gaul succeeded in forming
certain large political communities which are usually known as
the nations of medieval Europe. These political communities
as they existed about the year 1480 or 1500 possessed three of
the distinguishing features of nations: for each of them was of
large size, lived under a single government, and was composed
of men well suited for living together and under one government:
but all of them lacked one quality which is essential for the
making of a perfect nation: and that lacking quality was a
strong cohesion between the inhabitants of the different parts of
their territories. But it will be necessary to observe in detail
the processes by which the large political communities were
built up.</p>

<p>The Saxons, Angles, and Jutes who went to Britain
established themselves at first in a number of small settlements
on its southern and eastern coasts. From these settlements
they gradually pushed their way inland, and by 577 <span class="small">A.D.</span> they
had conquered nearly all the richest and most fertile regions in
Britain. The many political communities formed by settlement
and conquest were soon afterwards engaged in strife with one
another: in the beginning of the ninth century the West Saxons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
overpowered all their opponents and the West Saxon king
received the submission of all the German settlers in the island.
The conquering West Saxons and the conquered Angles and
Jutes showed the same genius for amalgamation as had been
shown by their forefathers in Germany long before: and by the
middle of the ninth century all the Germans in Britain (we
may now call them the English) had combined into a single
large political community. Three times over, in 867-878,
988-1016, and 1066-1070, the English were disturbed by
invasions of fresh immigrants from the continent of Europe:
but on each occasion the new comers were successfully united
in a single political community with the older settlers, and by
the year 1174 or at any rate by 1215 the English people had
been for the last time fashioned into one kindred under one
government.</p>

<p>The German peoples who invaded Spain were the Vandals,
the Alans, the Suevi and the Visigoths. The Visigoths proved
to be the strongest of the four, and by the early years of the
sixth century they had occupied nearly all the peninsula except
the north east corner, which they left to the Suevi. In the
enjoyment of the luxuries afforded by Roman civilisation, and
in the fancied security of their position, they neglected the arts
of war in which they had once so greatly excelled. In 710 <span class="small">A.D.</span>
their country was invaded and in the three following years was
conquered by Moors from Africa, so that none of it was left to
the Goths, the Suevi and some other tribes who were neither
Germans nor Moors, except some valleys among the Pyrenees
and a narrow strip of land about twenty miles broad and two
hundred miles long between the shore of the Bay of Biscay and
the mountain range of Cantabria and Asturias<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>.</p>

<p>During the five centuries which followed the Moorish conquest
of Spain the Goths who lived on the shores of the Bay of
Biscay and the inhabitants of the southern valleys of the
Pyrenees gradually expanded by reconquering territory from
the Moors, and before the middle of the twelfth century had
formed the two large political communities of Castile and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
Arragon<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>. Each of these communities during its long contest
with the Moors had acquired habits, thoughts and institutions
of its own, and they were but little inclined to join themselves
together into a single nation. The marriage of Ferdinand of
Arragon with Isabella of Castile in 1469 produced as its result
some time later that both Castile and Arragon were ruled by
the same government: but differences and jealousies between
the two peoples continued to exist long afterwards, even so late
as the War of the Spanish Succession in the eighteenth century<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>,
and it may well be doubted whether the two were ever welded
together into a single Spanish nation until after the terrible
misfortunes which they endured and the great efforts which
they made in a common cause during their war against Napoleon.</p>

<p>In Gaul the formation of a large political community was
delayed till late in the middle ages; in Germany, the original
home of the Germans, no large political community of great
importance was established till late in the seventeenth century.
In both countries the same hindrances stood in the way of the
making of great communities. The two countries were
included in the heterogeneous empires founded between
687 <span class="small">A.D.</span> and 800 <span class="small">A.D.</span> by the house of Pepin, especially
by Charlemagne, the greatest man of the house of Pepin: in
that empire, as in all heterogeneous empires, it was found
necessary that the central ruler should delegate very great
powers to the officials who governed provinces or districts:
and under the circumstances of the time it was also found
convenient for him to grant large estates of land to men
who had been useful to him and could be trusted to serve
him well in the future. In 843 Gaul (or the land of the West
Franks) was severed from the empire, and set up a king of its
own, who pretended to have the same powers as Charlemagne
had exercised. But the kings of the West Franks could not
control the local officials and landowners: by the eleventh
century the local officials and the landowners had converted
themselves into independent sovereigns, each ruling his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
lands and the men who lived on his lands: that particular
landowner who still enjoyed the title of king had no authority
(or at any rate no authority which he could habitually exercise)
except within the lands which specially belonged to him: and
even within his own lands he, like the other landowners in
Gaul, found that his authority was often disputed in arms
by his tenants.</p>

<p>In the early years of the twelfth century Louis VI., owning
or claiming to own an estate or demesne of land which had
Paris as its centre and measured about 140 miles from north to
south and about 50 miles from east to west, set himself to
establish order and government within his demesne by force
of arms. The inhabitants of the demesne valued the good
government and the order that was maintained among them by
Louis VI. and his grandson Philip II., and when the twelfth
century ended they may be counted as forming a small political
community or a body of men, possessing not only a common
government, but also common interests habits and wishes<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>.
In the thirteenth century the king's demesne was increased
by the acquisition of Normandy, Anjou, Maine, Touraine,
Poitou, Champagne in the north of Gaul, and by the distant
region of Languedoc in the south. The new parts of the
demesne were placed under the same government with the old,
and no doubt those of them which lay together in the north
of Gaul constantly tended to unite themselves into a single
political community. But the work of unification was greatly
impeded by causes all closely connected with the independence
which the different parts of Gaul had possessed in the tenth
and eleventh centuries, and it had not made very great progress
in 1415 when France was invaded by the armies of the English.
After the expulsion of the invaders the work was taken up
again and carried on with better success by Charles VII.,
Louis XI. and the later kings of France.</p>

<p>In Germany events followed much the same course as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
Gaul; but they occurred later. The extinction of the
Emperor's authority and the rise of the local governors and
landowners to independence did not come to pass in Germany
till the middle of the thirteenth century; and none of the
princes who then gained their independence succeeded during
the middle ages in rising to preeminence above the rest.</p>

<p>In order to complete our survey of the chief political
communities of the middle ages we must glance at northern
Italy and Switzerland. Northern Italy contained many important
towns which had been founded by the Romans: during
the early part of the middle ages it became the commercial
centre of Europe: the towns grew in wealth and influence,
and before the year 1200 they succeeded in making themselves
independent, and constituted themselves as city states, resembling
the city states of ancient Greece. In Switzerland
three tribes of mountaineers in Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden,
in 1291, agreed to form a league or permanent alliance, which
was afterwards joined by many of their neighbours, though
no steps towards forming a federal state were taken till about
the year 1500<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>.</p>

<p>It has been remarked already that the large political
communities of the middle ages were not thoroughly coherent
or consolidated. A want of coherence was exhibited both in
France and in England by the frequent recurrence of rebellions
or civil strife, in France under John II. and Charles VI., in
England under Edward II., Richard II. and Henry VI.; still
more clearly was it made visible in France in 1356-1360 and
1415-1422 by the inability of the French to act unitedly in
resistance to an invading enemy, and by the ease with which
portions of French territory were detached from the dominions
of the French king and transferred to the victorious invaders.
The danger of civil discord was great enough in the fifteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
century when it arose mainly from the armies of retainers kept
by ambitious noblemen: but it became still greater in the
sixteenth, when differences of creed divided each people into
two hostile camps. The disruptive forces at length became so
strong that both France and England seemed to be in danger
of losing the character of political communities and of lapsing
into masses of heterogeneous elements; and accordingly each
country adopted that kind of government which is best suited
to hold heterogeneous elements together, namely, a monarchy
with almost unlimited power. The subsequent histories of the
two countries, though dissimilar in general character, were in
one respect alike: in both countries civil war actually occurred,
in France in the sixteenth century, in England in the seventeenth;
and in each country experience of the miseries of war
brought a love for the blessings of peace, with the result that
France from 1700 to 1789 and England from 1745 to this day
present very perfect examples of united nations.</p>

<p>Besides the nations of France, England, Spain, Scotland,
Sweden, Norway and Denmark which grew up directly from
the large political communities of the middle ages, others have
been founded in more recent times, some of them having only a
single government, and being therefore called unitary states, and
others having one government for some purposes and many
governments for other purposes, and being known as federal
states. Among the unitary or non-federal nations we must
notice Brandenburg-Prussia 1700-1866, Italy since 1859,
Belgium, Holland, Greece, and the Balkan States: among the
federal nations the United States of America and modern
Switzerland stand out conspicuously. The German Empire
founded in 1871 is a federal nation, though it differs from other
federal nations because Prussia, one of its component states, is
larger than all the other component states put together:
Austria Hungary was for centuries a mere heterogeneous
empire, but in recent times its parts have been held together
by the possession of common interests and not by force, so that
it has acquired some of the characters of a federation, though it
cannot be said that it has grown together into a single nation.</p>

<p>But the making and consolidation of nations is not the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
kind of state-building that has gone on since the end of the
middle ages: for other sorts of construction have also been
actively carried on, and they have resulted in the making of a
number of states that are larger than nations. In some cases
two European nations or a European nation and some other
European population have been brought under a single government:
in other cases a European nation has expanded by the
foundation of colonies far away from its original abode: and yet
again in some cases a European state has conquered a host of
non-European peoples and formed them into a heterogeneous
empire dependent on itself.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous instances of the union of a nation
with another nation or people occurred in 1683 when Alsace
was acquired by France, in 1707 when England and Scotland
placed themselves under one government, in 1771, 1793 and
1795 when parts of Poland were annexed to Prussia, and in
1801 when the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
was formed. The enlarged states which result from such unions
can never be strictly called single nations immediately after the
union has taken place, and for a time at least after the union
they must be denoted merely as unitary states: but usually
they have not for most purposes differed very greatly from
nations: for in all cases one of the two peoples united together
has been a large and well consolidated nation and the other has
been much smaller and far less perfectly organized: and consequently
the larger partner in the union has had a predominant
share in the government, and has gradually succeeded in
communicating its own national characteristics and feelings to
some part at least of the population of the lesser partner in the
union.</p>

<p>A state formed by colonial expansion presents difficulties to
any one who tries to define its nature. It is like a family of
plants all sprung from one stock; the stock has sent out
offshoots, which have themselves struck root, but are still
connected with the parent stock from which they sprang. In
one sense such an expanded state is still a single political
community: in another sense each of the colonies which belongs
to it is also a political community, though it never possesses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
complete independence, and therefore is not to be counted as a
state.</p>

<p>The greatest conquerors of distant lands outside Europe
have been the Spaniards, the English and the Russians. Their
conquests formed three great political aggregates or heterogeneous
empires, the Spanish Empire in southern and central
America, the Indian Empire, and the Russian Empire. The
Indian and the Russian Empires are administered by methods
more or less resembling those used in the old heterogeneous
Empire of the Romans by Constantine the Great and his
successors: the administration of the Spaniards was very defective
from the outset, and at the beginning of the nineteenth
century their empire broke up into a number of independent
states.</p>

<p>And now I may attempt a classification of all the more
important forms that have been assumed by groups or collections
of men living under governments. First of all, some of
these groups are mere political aggregates, having little in
common save the fact of living under one government, and the
rest are political communities whose members have much else
beside government in common. The mere aggregates will not
need to be further divided; they are all heterogeneous empires
held together by force. The political communities must be
divided into three classes, tribes, cities, and the larger political
communities. The class tribes needs no subdivision: cities
must be divided according as they are inexpansive or expansive:
the larger political communities (a class identical with the
nations and those communities which possess many of the
qualities of nations) need be subdivided only into unitary states
or large political communities each with a single government
only, and federal states or large political communities in which
there is one government for some purposes and many governments
for other purposes.</p>

<p>The essentials of a perfect classification are four in number.
Firstly, it ought to be exhaustive or to comprehend all individual
specimens, so that no individual shall be without a place in it.
Secondly, the marks which distinguish the classes should be
easily recognisable. Thirdly, the marks of one class should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
never be present in a single individual together with the marks
of another: for, if they are, the individual is in two classes at
once. Fourthly (and this is most essential of all), the classes
should be such that many important general propositions are
true of all the individuals which compose any given class.</p>

<p>It will be well to try to ascertain in what measure these
essentials are found in a classification of European bodies
politic under the five heads of tribes, cities, nations unitary and
federal, and heterogeneous empires. Firstly, the classification
is, I believe, so far exhaustive that it includes all those bodies
which most clearly deserve to be called both political and
European: it does not however provide a place for mere feudal
principalities which never grew into nations, nor is it intended
to include the Asiatic Empire of the Turks in Europe. Secondly,
the marks which distinguish the classes are easily recognisable.
Thirdly, the classification is decidedly imperfect because it does
not make it impossible for a political body to be in two classes
at once. But the possibility that a political body may be in
two classes at once does not occur except during those periods
when a community is gradually growing out of one form and
into another. Such periods of transition have occurred in the
history of many peoples: there was one in Greek history when
the tribes were growing into cities: one in Roman history when
the Republic was ceasing to be a mere enlarged city and was
growing into a heterogeneous empire: and one in English
history when the English were losing the character of a tribe
and acquiring the qualities of a nation. But such periods of
transition do not occur in the life of all peoples, and where they
do occur, they are not usually of long duration when compared
with the whole of the people's history. Fourthly, there are
many important general propositions which are true of all or of
nearly all the individuals in any given class. To establish such
general propositions by historical evidence will be my task in
the present chapters and in any future additions which I may
be able to make to them. Some of these general propositions
may be at once indicated in an imperfect form, though the
proofs of them must be postponed.</p>

<p>The most important of these propositions are those which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
assert that there is an intimate connexion between the form of
a political body and the form of government by which it is
ruled: and that each of the forms that a political body can
assume has a certain type or certain types of government
commonly and almost uniformly associated with it. The
propositions may be set down in the following way. Firstly,
all the tribes of which we have any good records have had
governments not differing from one another in any important
particular. Secondly, cities pure and simple or inexpansive
cities have usually three kinds of government only, pure
oligarchy, or pure despotism, or direct and almost unmixed
democracy: and Republican Rome, the single example of an
expanded city, had a government peculiar to itself. Thirdly, in
the large unitary states or nations, it is, roughly speaking, true
that three kinds of government have succeeded one another in
regular sequence: at first, during the middle ages, they were
under governments in which power belonged partly to a king
and partly to an assembly of estates, the assembly consisting
usually of the nobles, the prelates of the church, and representatives
from rural districts and towns: afterwards, when they
were in danger of disruption, they placed themselves under
monarchies of unlimited or almost unlimited power, and these
monarchies usually continued to exist after all danger of disruption
had been removed: and now, in modern times, all unitary
states are ruled by cabinets under the control or supervision of
popular representative assemblies. Turning to federal states,
which form the fourth class of political communities, we find
that all of them are alike in having a central government both
legislative and executive, whose sphere of action is strictly
limited by the constitution to certain portions of the work of
governing, and in permitting each of the states, which are joined
together in the federation, also to have a government of its
own, which controls all business except that portion which is
allotted by the constitution to the central government of the
federation. And, lastly, heterogeneous empires must, unless
they are to break in pieces, have governments whose chief
object is centralisation. Supreme power may belong to a
despotic monarch or to a small body of men appointed by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
foreign state which rules the empire: but in all cases the one
thing necessary is that there shall be a central supreme power
and that the commands of that supreme power shall be implicitly
obeyed by everyone within the empire.</p>

<p>It will be observed that most of the propositions which I
have enumerated are qualified with a saving word or saving
clause to admit the existence of exceptions. The exceptions
however are not, so far as I can judge, very numerous. Among
the governments of city states the Cleisthenean constitution at
Athens was exceptional, since, though it was more like a
democracy than anything else, it was not by any means an
unmixed democracy: and some similar exceptions occur, I
believe, in the earliest part of the history of some medieval
cities in Lombardy. During the middle ages, it was only in
those peoples which best deserved the name of large political
communities or incipient nations that an effective division of
power between a king and an assembly of estates was to be
found, and even in them it was not maintained without
occasional interruptions: in England for example there were
three periods (1258-1259, 1310-1322, and 1388-1389) of pure
oligarchy, and two (1200-1215, and 1397-1399) of pure despotism:
among the French and in some other peoples which
had not truly acquired the character of political communities,
we find a semblance of a division of power, but not the reality.
The assertion that the nations during the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries were ruled by strong monarchical governments
scarcely needs any qualification: there is however a
short exceptional period in English history, 1649-1653, when
the government was an oligarchy; and Poland never acquired
a strong monarchical government, but was punished for the
absence of such a government by ceasing to exist. In the
course of the French Revolution 1789-1795 there occur some
seeming exceptions to the propositions about forms of government
which have been enumerated: but I believe they will be
found not to be exceptions, if we observe that during those
years Paris was practically an independent city state.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="ph">GREEK POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS. HEROIC MONARCHIES.</p>


<p>The political institutions of the Greeks will be examined
first, because the Greeks are known to us at an earlier period
than any other European people.</p>

<p>Hellas, the land of the Greeks, is about equal in size to half
of Scotland or Ireland or to a third of England<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>. It is intersected
by a network of continuous mountain ranges, which
cannot be crossed without difficulty, and these ranges are almost
everywhere so near together that it is impossible to travel more
than twenty miles in any direction without crossing one of
them. There are therefore no plains of any considerable extent,
and the country is cut up into very numerous small areas, each
enclosed, except towards the sea, within natural barriers which
make egress and entrance alike difficult. These areas are of
varying minuteness: by far the greater number of them
measure only ten miles by ten, or twenty by five, but a few are
of larger dimensions, and, in particular, Argolis contains about
four hundred and fifty square miles, and is as large as Bedfordshire,
Attica contains seven hundred and twenty, and just equals
Berkshire, and Laconia, with about nine hundred, is of the same
size as Warwickshire<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p>If communication by land is difficult, by sea it is easy, and
was easy even in the earliest times. Greece and its islands
have as much sea-board as any equal area in Europe; most of
the natural divisions of the country have their share of coast
with sheltered beaches where the boats or small ships of ancient
times could be drawn up in safety: the Mediterranean, though
it is sometimes as dangerous as any sea, is often calm: and by
the age of Homer it had come to be a great highway for war,
piracy and commerce.</p>

<p>The career of all the Greek communities, except Sparta,
divides itself readily into periods. The first period, lasting till
perhaps 700 <span class="small">B.C.</span> or 650 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, was the period of tribes and tribal
governments: the second, lasting to 338 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, was the period of
cities and city governments. The period of the cities must
however be divided into three lesser periods, each characterised
by the prevalence of a certain kind of city government: the
first of these lesser periods lasted from about 700 <span class="small">B.C.</span> to 600 <span class="small">B.C.</span>,
the second from 600 <span class="small">B.C.</span> to 500 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and the third from 500 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
to 338 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Between 700 <span class="small">B.C.</span> and 600 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Athens, Corinth and
Megara were under the domination of groups of privileged
families, and many Greek cities in Sicily were also governed by
small groups of citizens distinguished either by birth or by
wealth: and, since the rule of a few is known as an aristocracy
if the few rulers are the men best qualified to rule and if they
use their power for the good of the whole community, but as an
oligarchy if the few rulers govern for their own selfish interest,
the century may be called the period of the early aristocracies and
oligarchies. Between 600 <span class="small">B.C.</span> and 500 <span class="small">B.C.</span> nearly every Greek
city, both in Greece proper and elsewhere, came under the rule
of a τύραννος or usurper of absolute power, so that the century
may be called the age of the tyrants or usurpers. And lastly,
between 500 <span class="small">B.C.</span> and 338 <span class="small">B.C.</span> in many of the Greek cities a
system of government was set up under which the whole body
of the citizens acting collectively conducted the work of government,
or at least all parts of it which can in the nature of
things be conducted by a numerous assembly, while in other
cities a small body of the richest citizens ruled selfishly for
their own advantage and the advantage of their class; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
since any system in which the whole body of citizens directly
conduct the work of government or the greater part of the
work of government is known as a democracy, while the selfish
rule of a few is, as we have seen, called an oligarchy, the period
may best be called the age of the democracies and of the later
oligarchies.</p>

<p>The Spartans were unlike, in their history their institutions
and the aims of their policy, not only to all other Greek
communities but perhaps to every other community that has
ever existed: they never completely grew out of their tribal
condition, never entirely abandoned their tribal government,
and never formed themselves into a city like the other Greek
cities: and besides all this they were in so many ways unlike
to the rest of mankind that it will be necessary for me to speak
of them by themselves and apart from the rest of the Greeks.</p>

<p>The Greek communities and their political systems from the
earliest times to the first overthrow of Greek independence in
338 <span class="small">B.C.</span> will be treated in the present and the next two
chapters in the following order: firstly, we shall examine the
tribes and the tribal governments, secondly, the institutions and
government of the Spartans, and thirdly, the cities and the
city-governments.</p>


<h3>THE GREEK TRIBES AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS.</h3>

<p>The numerous tribes which composed the Greek race ranged
themselves in several groups, distinguished from one another
in name, characteristics and fortunes. Among these groups
the Achæans, the Dorians and the Ionians are historically the
most important. The Achæan group includes all the tribes
that are conspicuous in the Iliad and Odyssey: and from this
circumstance it may safely be inferred that, when those poems
were composed, the Achæan tribes had made more progress
than any other Greeks in knowledge and political organisation.
The Dorians in the days of Homer were an obscure tribe living
in a little mountain valley of Northern Greece: in the next
age they invaded the Peloponnesus, expelled the Achæans from
their homes, and formed themselves into the four peoples of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
the Spartans, the Messenians, the Corinthians and the Argives.
The Ionian tribes, the Athenians and twelve of the Greek cities
of Asia Minor, including Miletus and Ephesus, were even later
than the Dorian peoples in rising to importance. I shall deal
first with the Achæans and then with the Dorians and Ionians.</p>


<h4>1. <i>The Achæan tribes in the heroic age.</i></h4>

<p>When the Iliad and the Odyssey were composed the
Achæans had formed a great number of small independent
communities, some inhabiting islands, and others living in
valleys surrounded by chains of mountains. The only tribe
whose methods of government are depicted in some detail was
one of the least of the Greek peoples, and had its home in
Ithaca, a rocky island of the Ionian sea about seventeen miles
long and three or four miles broad. The larger tribes were
the Mycenæans, the Spartans, and the Achæans of Phthiotis.
All the Achæan tribes were much alike in their political
institutions: for the same political terms βασιλεύς, ἀγορή,
γέροντες, λαοί are used in reference to the various tribes
without distinction. Their governments were tribal in character,
and we may call them either by the generic name of tribal
governments, or by the name, which they more usually bear, of
heroic monarchies.</p>

<p>The government of an Achæan tribe was conducted, in time
of peace, in assemblies (ἀγορα). The purposes for which they
met included the announcement of any important news<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>, discussion
of any public business or question of policy<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> or the
settlement of a litigation<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>. Our knowledge of their character
and proceedings is derived from a full description in the second
book of the Odyssey of an assembly held at Ithaca, and a
shorter description in the Iliad<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>.</p>

<p>Whenever the king desired that an assembly should be held
he gave the heralds orders to require the immediate attendance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
of the elders and the people<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>. The place of meeting was an
open space in the city set apart for the purpose. In the midst
was a circle of stone seats for the king and the elders<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>, and one
of the seats belonged specially to the king<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>: outside were the
people, all of whom were compelled by the heralds to seat
themselves on the ground<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> and to be silent<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>. When this had
been done, the work of the assembly began; the speakers were
the king and the elders, and the people either kept silence or
perhaps indicated their approval by shouting or their dissent
by murmurs. The councillors who sat with the king and had
the right of speaking were for the most part (as the name
γέροντες, if taken literally, denotes) men of age and experience:
but younger men of good family, such as the wooers of Penelope<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>,
were also sometimes present among them and shared their
privileges.</p>

<p>The assembly at Ithaca was irregularly summoned. The
words of the first speaker, the aged Ægyptius, show that
according to custom the king alone had the prerogative of
issuing a summons by the voice of the heralds. Odysseus had
been absent for twenty years: and Ægyptius says, "Since the
godlike Odysseus departed in his hollow ships our assembly and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
session has never been held. And now who is he that summoned
us? who was compelled by so great necessity? has he heard
news of our warriors coming back, and hastens to tell us? or
has he aught else of our country's weal to speak about? I say
he is a good man, God bless him! and may Zeus perform for
him whatever his heart desires!<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>"</p>

<p>The business of the assembly at Ithaca was not exactly
judicial and can scarcely be described as deliberation on policy.
Telemachus summoned the elders and the people in order to
declare to them that the proceedings of the suitors were
intolerable to him, that he bade them leave his house, that he
would resist them by force, if he could, and that if they were
slain in his house no price for their lives would be due from
him to their kindred.</p>

<p>The assembly came to no formal resolution: the practical
result of it was settled by the speeches of the elders without
any intervention of the common folk, and was expressed by the
last speaker Leiocritus, who declared that the suitors were not
afraid of Telemachus nor of Odysseus himself, and bade all
those who were present to go away each about his own business.</p>

<p>An assembly occupied in administering justice was depicted
in a compartment of the shield of Achilles, which the poet thus
describes<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>: "A people too was there, gathered in assembly:
and in their midst a dispute had arisen, and two men were
disputing about the price (wergild) of a man that had been
slain. The one was declaring aloud to the multitude that he
had paid the whole, the other that he had received none of it.
And both were ready to go before a judge to get a decision:
and the people on this side and on that were cheering them on,
but were restrained by the heralds. And there sat the elders
on seats of wrought stone in a circle protected by the gods,
holding staves given them by the loud-voiced heralds; and then
the elders were arising in turn to give judgement. And in the
midst were lying two talents of gold to be given to him whose
judgement was the straightest<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>."</p>

<p>In this assembly, as in the other, power belonged solely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
those who formed the inner circle. The presence of the king in
the judicial assembly is not mentioned, but kings did sometimes
take part in giving dooms, for Nestor says to Agamemnon: "O
most famous son of Atreus, Agamemnon, king of men, thou
shalt be my ending and thou my beginning, because thou art
king of many people and Zeus has given thee the sceptre <em>and
judgements</em> that thou mayst be their counselor<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>."</p>

<p>There is a story in the Odyssey which indicates more clearly
than the descriptions of the assemblies that, in time of peace,
supreme power belonged to the king and the elders jointly and
not to the king alone or to the elders alone. While Laertes
was reigning in Ithaca three hundred sheep belonging to
Ithacans were stolen by robbers from Messenia. Odysseus, the
king's son, was sent to ask satisfaction for the wrong: and it is
expressly stated that it was the king and the other elders who
empowered him to act as ambassador<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>.</p>

<p>In time of war the king had supreme and exclusive command
over his tribe. Thus when Achilles king of the Phthiotians
was angry with Agamemnon, he was able without consultation
with any one to withdraw the whole Phthiotian contingent
from aiding in the war against the Trojans: and, when he
began to relent, nothing was needed but a word from him
to place his forces in the field again under the orders of his
friend Patroclus<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>. Agamemnon on the other hand, being the
commander of a host composed of contingents from many tribes,
found it necessary, before issuing any orders to the whole army,
to consult the kings who were taking part with him in his
enterprise<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>.</p>

<p>Our conclusions about the political system which prevailed
in the Greek tribes of the heroic age can be shortly summed
up. In time of peace all public business was conducted in
assemblies: in these assemblies the king and the elders alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
had the right of speaking, and the king was expected to act
according to the advice of the elders. In time of war the king
was commander-in-chief, and could act without control from
any one.</p>

<p>Besides the political institutions of the ancient Greeks, some
of the general conditions of their life may be noticed. They
depended for their subsistence partly on their cattle and partly
on the produce of the ground, and most of the poorer free men,
not possessing slaves, lived in the country to tend their herds
and till their lands. Some, who had no herds and no lands of
their own, worked as labourers for hire<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>. The estates and the
cattle of the kings and rich men were committed to the charge
of slaves captured in war or in freebooting expeditions<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>. The
kings and rich men themselves lived, not scattered over the
open country after the fashion of the Germans described by
Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>, but collected in cities. Thus at Ithaca the house of
the king and the houses of the wooers of Penelope were all
close together: for at the end of the first day in the story of
the Odyssey the wooers "went each to his house to sleep<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>" and
on the morrow at the dawn of day at the summons of the
heralds they "came very quickly to the assembly<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>": Pylos,
where Nestor lived, is called the gathering place and the abodes
of the Pylians<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>: and, not to multiply instances, words denoting
cities are regularly applied in the Homeric poems to the
dwelling-places of the heroes.</p>

<p>The cities of the heroic age had, for their defence, in all
cases a fortress or strong place of refuge close at hand, and
some of them at least were entirely encircled with a wall.
Argos lay at the foot of the steep isolated mountain of the
Larissa which rose about a thousand feet above it: Corinth was
under the still loftier Acrocorinthus; Mycenæ and Athens had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
each its Acropolis, a strong fortress built on a rock rising
abruptly but to no great height above the town. That in some
cases the lower city, as distinct from the Acropolis, had also its
own outer wall is proved by the whole story of the siege of
Troy, which shows that cities entirely enclosed in fortifications
were well known to Homer<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>.</p>

<p>There are numberless passages in the Iliad and Odyssey
which prove that the houses of the heroes were well stored
with wealth. The suitors who intruded as guests at the house
of Telemachus always found plenty of cattle, bread, wine and
oil ready at hand for their riotous feasts, and yet Telemachus
was but a poor man among the Greek princes. When
Telemachus paid a visit to Menelaus and Helen at Sparta he
was astonished to find that their palace glittered with gold and
silver, with electrum (a mixture of two metals) and with ivory<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>.
The chamber of Odysseus at Ithaca contained abundance of
gold and bronze, and clothing in chests and sweet smelling oil
and wine in jars against his return<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>. The metal used for
weapons was brass or bronze: agricultural implements were
chiefly made of iron: of the precious metals gold was more
commonly used than silver<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>. We do not hear that any of these
metals were obtained in the heroic age from the soil of Greece
itself, and may fairly conjecture that they were brought to the
Greeks by the Phœnicians who in that age were more active in
trade than any other people<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>The population of a city must have consisted of the wealthy
families who had slaves to till their lands and tend their flocks
and of those few artificers or professional men whose business
brought them to live near the houses of the rich. Among the
handicraftsmen were the carpenter, the copper-smith, the
leather-dresser, the worker in gold: the professions were those
of the leech, the prophet and the bard<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>. Thus it may be that
in an assembly the people outside the sacred circle did not
greatly surpass in number the elders who sat within it: for
there were no classes to constitute a people except the younger
members of the families of the elders and the few men who
were induced to live in the city to find employment for their
knowledge or skill.</p>


<h4>2. <i>The Dorians and the Ionians in the heroic age.</i></h4>

<p>Before the beginning of Greek History, properly so called,
the Achæan peoples, so important in the eyes of Homer, had
sunk into comparative insignificance, and the first places in the
Hellenic world had been filled by Dorians and Ionians. The
original abode of the Dorians was a small mountainous country
called Doris not far from Thermopylæ<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>. From hence bands of
adventurers had gone forth and, invading Peloponnesus, had
expelled the Achæans from Sparta, Messenia, Argos and Corinth,
had occupied their territories and had copied their institutions.
The Ionians in Attica had grown in prosperity and power, and,
like the Dorian tribes, had adopted that form of government
which I have called heroic monarchy.</p>

<p>Of the Dorian kingly government at Corinth we know
nothing but its existence<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>: of the Messenian kings we have
many stories told by Myron of Priene, but, on reading them
side by side with the stories told by Geoffrey of Monmouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
about King Arthur, I thought that for complete untrustworthiness
there was nothing to choose between the two authors<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>:
concerning the early kings of Argos Athens and Sparta, a few
facts are established on good authority, and these I shall now
proceed to state.</p>

<p>Argos, with its two neighbours Mycenæ and Tiryns, was in
some respects unlike the other Greek communities. Elsewhere
in Greece during the heroic age each community occupied the
whole of a natural division of the country, and had its territory
fenced round with natural barriers. In the Argolic plain three
Achæan communities had found room to settle, exactly as in
Italy many communities found room to settle in and around the
plain of Latium: and thus the Argolic communities rather
resembled the Latin cities than the Greek tribes. Their city
walls were of exceptional strength, as the remains of them
testify: their kings were richer and were exalted to a greater
eminence above their subjects than the other Greek kings, for
the palace of the king at Tiryns occupies nearly the whole of
the upper citadel and is such as to demand a most prodigal
expenditure of labour for its construction<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>, and Agamemnon
king of Mycenæ is represented by the poet of the Iliad as a
powerful monarch. It cannot be doubted that the three cities
had the same reasons for making their walls strong and their
kings powerful as the Romans had in the days of Servius
Tullius: they feared that they might be conquered by their
neighbours, and hoped that they might themselves be the
conquerors.</p>

<p>After the Dorian conquest the three cities still continued to
exist: Argos was the strongest of them, but Mycenæ acted
independently of Argos so late as the year 480 <span class="small">B.C.</span> in sending a
contingent to fight against the Persians at Thermopylæ<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>. The
great power of the Dorian monarchy was conspicuous in the
reign of Pheidon, who at some time between 750 <span class="small">B.C.</span> and
600 <span class="small">B.C.</span> became so powerful that he was able to conduct an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
expedition from his own city in the east of the Peloponnesus to
Olympia in the west and to deprive the Eleians by force of
their prerogative of presiding over the Olympic festival<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>. He
also established a hegemony or lordship over a number of Greek
peoples in the neighbourhood of Argos, which had long been
independent. The tradition of his conquest says simply that
he "recovered the whole lot of Têmenus which had been broken
up into many parts<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>." Têmenus, according to the legends of the
Heracleids, was one of the leaders of the Dorians in their
invasion of the Peloponnesus: and it seems that his "lot" must
have included the tribes that lived at Cleonæ, Phlius, Sicyon,
Epidaurus, Trœzen, and Ægina. Pheidon's conquest of these
tribes was a remarkable achievement, since all of them were
protected against Argos by mountain ranges or by sea: and it
gave him such despotic authority over his own subjects at
Argos that he is counted among the <span lang="grc">τύραννοι</span><a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>. But it seems
that he ought not, strictly speaking, to be reckoned among
them, being unlike to the rest of them in two important particulars:
first, that his despotic authority at Argos was no
doubt necessary in order to enable Argos to keep control
over the dependent peoples, and second, that it is not likely
that he ever incurred the hatred of the people of Argos: for,
if he had been hated by his own subjects, his power outside
Argos must have promptly come to an end. After his time
the power of the king at Argos ceased to be despotic, the
neighbouring tribes recovered their independence, and the
monarchy sank into obscurity, though it continued to exist so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
late as 480 <span class="small">B.C.</span> when Greece was invaded by the Persians
under Xerxes<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>.</p>

<p>In Attica we can carry back our view not only to the age of
the heroic monarchy but to the age which preceded it. The
country, though it is, as we have seen, of small extent, and
though it is not traversed by any continuous ranges of
mountains, was originally peopled by a number of independent
communities, each contained within a single village or small
township: and it is probable that these little communities
retained their independence till after the time of Homer; for
Athens, which rose to greatness by subjugating them, is rarely
mentioned in the Homeric poems, and never, I believe, in any
passage which belongs to the poems as they were originally
composed. In course of time however a powerful king arose at
Athens, who succeeded in bringing the whole country under a
single monarchy of the heroic type: and Thucydides tells us
that in his own days the union of Attica under Athens was
regularly celebrated at a public festival<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>.</p>

<p>The Spartans, instead of having one king, had two kings
and two royal families<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>, so that their system of government
may best be described as a dual heroic kingship. Of this
government, and of the conquests made by the Spartans while
they lived under it, I shall have more to say in the next
chapter.</p>

<p>Of the other tribes in the prehistoric age we have no
traditions: but Thucydides<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> says without hesitation concerning
the early Greeks in general that their governments were
"hereditary kingly governments with limited prerogatives":
and the same view, which was shared by all the later Greeks,
falls in with the little that is known of the Greek peoples in the
first two or three centuries of their history.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>
<p>It is clear from many indications that the monarchical part
of the old tribal constitutions was necessary or especially useful
to the primitive Greek peoples so long as they were employed
in making conquests or settlements of new territory, and no
longer. In the prehistoric age the Athenians and all the
Dorian peoples were conquering peoples: and all of them made
their conquests under the leadership of kings. In the next age,
which came between the heroic period and the beginning of
Greek history in the proper sense of the word, the great
majority of the Greek peoples had ceased to acquire new
territory within Greece and had also ceased or were ceasing to
be monarchically governed: two peoples, the Spartans and the
Argives, were exceptional both in continuing to make territorial
conquests and in still living under kingly rule.</p>

<p class="ph">SPARTA.</p>


<p>The Spartans present so many peculiarities and are so
unlike to any other people that I must divide what I have
to say about them under separate heads. In regard to the
Spartans before the Peloponnesian war I shall describe (I) their
political surroundings, (II) their customs, (III) their constitution:
for the period of the war and that which followed it,
I shall give (IV) a general view of their commonwealth as it
then stood.</p>

<p>I. The Spartans or Spartiatæ were the strongest and most
warlike of those Dorian tribes who at some time after the time
of Homer and yet long before the beginning of history migrated
from the rocky valley of Doris in northern Greece and invaded
the Peloponnesus. They subsequently lived in the unwalled
city of Sparta as a small nation of conquerors surrounded by
the two subject populations of the Periœci and the Helots,
who peopled the country of Laconia. In 480 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, when the
Spartans were at the height of their power, just after their
king Leonidas and his three hundred had made their heroic
defence at Thermopylæ, Xerxes asked Demaratus, who had
once been king of Sparta but had been deposed, to tell him
how many warriors remained to the Lacedæmonians and how
many of them were as brave as the three hundred; Demaratus
replied: "O king, the number of the Lacedæmonians is great
and their cities are many: thou shalt know what thou desirest
to learn. There is in Lacedæmon a city Sparta, of about eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
thousand fighting men, and all these are like to those that
fought at Thermopylæ: the other Lacedæmonians are not
indeed equal to these, but yet they are brave<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>." As the
Spartans of military age numbered eight thousand we may
reckon that forty thousand was about the number of persons,
including women and children, who belonged to Spartan families
and formed the Spartan nation.</p>

<p>The Periœci were "the other Lacedæmonians, not indeed
equal to the Spartiatæ, but yet brave men," and by them the
cities of Lacedæmon except Sparta were inhabited. It seems
that the Periœci were decidedly more numerous than the
Spartiatæ: in the year after the conversation between Xerxes
and Demaratus the force, which was sent out to fight the
Persian general Mardonius and which took part in the great
battle of Platæa, consisted of five thousand Spartans, of thirty-five
thousand light armed Helots, seven Helots being allotted
as attendants to each Spartan, and of five thousand picked
hoplites or heavy armed warriors from the Periœci<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>. As these
Periœci were picked men, there were more to pick from: of the
force of Spartiatæ Grote remarks that "throughout the whole
course of Grecian history we never hear of any number of
Spartan citizens at all approaching to five thousand being
put on foreign service at the same time<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>."</p>

<p>It is not certain whether the Periœci were Achæans or
Dorians in origin. Whichever they were, our view of the
Spartans and their government will be much the same. The
Periœci were not treated with distrust or systematic cruelty:
they retained their personal freedom under the Spartan rule,
they continued to inhabit the towns or cities of Laconia, and
in each of their towns to manage their local affairs for themselves<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>:
but they had no voice whatever in the politics of
Sparta, which were controlled exclusively by the Spartans.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
Occasionally a man of ability from among the Periœci was
promoted to a position of trust: thus in the year 412 <span class="small">B.C.</span> a
man named Deiniadas, a Periœcus, commanded a squadron of
ships in the war on the coasts of Asia Minor and of Lesbos<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>.</p>

<p>The Helots formed in the fifth century B.C. a large population
of serfs who tilled the soil: they were the property of
the Spartan state, which however placed the services of Helots
at the disposal of the Spartans and Periœci for the cultivation
of their estates. The Helots, who were bound to the soil on
any given estate were compelled every year to render a fixed
quantity of produce to the owner: on the residue they and
their families subsisted.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>.
</p>

<p>The name <span lang="grc">εἵλωτες</span> denotes captives taken in war<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>. It was
believed by the Greeks that the Spartans, when first they
made their conquest of Laconia, reduced some of those whom
they conquered to the condition of Helots as above described:
and the account given by them of the institutions of Lycurgus
implies that the lawgiver foresaw some danger such as would
arise from a large servile population. But if the Helots were
dangerous in the age of Lycurgus, they became far more
dangerous after the Spartans had conquered the Messenian
country that lay to the west of Laconia and of the range of
Taygetus. The Messenians were Dorians like the Spartans,
and like them had conquered a large district of the Peloponnesus.
Against these neighbours and kinsmen the Spartans
waged two long wars, one probably in the eighth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>
and the other probably in the seventh<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>. In the second war
they were completely successful, and at the end of it they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
reduced the Messenians, who had for some two or three centuries
been a free and independent Dorian people, to the
condition of Helots<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>. But to hold the territory was almost
as hard as to win it: and to keep the Messenians enslaved
was almost as hard as to enslave them. The territory is
separated from Laconia by a chain of mountains, and the new
serfs were more dangerous than the original Helots because
they remembered their freedom. From the time of the conquest
of Messenia the little Spartan nation stood in perpetual
danger of a great servile revolt. When, in 464 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, a rebellion
of the Helots actually occurred, it imperilled the existence
of the state. The Spartans at one time despaired of putting it
down without external aid, and, when the Athenians offered
them the services of an armed force, accepted the offer. Subsequently,
when their jealousy of Athens revived and they
resolved to rely on their own unaided efforts, they had to spend
all their strength for nine years before they compelled the
Helots in their stronghold on Mount Ithomê to capitulate on
condition that they should depart from the Peloponnesus and
never return<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>. Even after these brave men had gone into
exile, there were plenty of Helots left to keep the Spartans in
anxiety: and Thucydides in telling of the treacherous murder
of the two thousand Helots in 424 <span class="small">B.C.</span> remarks incidentally
that "at all times most of the institutions of the Lacedæmonians
were framed with a view to the Helots, to guard
against their insurrections<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>."</p>

<p>II. The singular regulations under which the Spartans
lived were designed to discipline all the males among their
scanty numbers into a formidable military brotherhood. Possibly
some of these regulations had already been established<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
before they left their original abodes in Doris to migrate to
the Peloponnesus: they were attributed to Lycurgus, a wise
lawgiver, who is placed by the legends after the migration
and some generations before the first Spartans of whom we
have any historical knowledge: but the extreme strictness
of their enforcement may have dated from the end of the
second Messenian war, which reduced a whole people to
servitude.</p>

<p>The earliest detailed account of the customs of the Spartans
is given in a treatise on the Commonwealth of the Lacedæmonians,
which has been attributed to Xenophon. Whoever
the author may have been, it speaks of the Spartans as if they
were almost irresistible in warfare: and hence it must be
inferred that it was written before 371 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, when they suffered
a severe and humiliating defeat at Leuctra in Bœotia. It
gives a picture of Spartan customs whose chief outlines I shall
try to reduce within the dimensions of a sketch.</p>

<p>The aim of the Spartan discipline was to ensure the greatest
possible efficiency in the little band of warriors who formed the
Spartan army. To this end it was first necessary that the race
should be healthy: and as strong parents were likely to have
strong offspring, the women no less than the men were trained
in gymnastic exercises and contests<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>. The boys ceased at an
early age to be under the sole authority of their own parents
and were placed under the command of an officer of state
whose title was <span lang="grc">παιδονόμος</span> or warden of the boys<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>, and were
also compelled to obey any Spartan who had children of his
own<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>. The training of the boys under their warden is not
described in detail: but there is no doubt it consisted in
gymnastics and in marching and dancing to music. The moral
qualities which were insisted on were firstly personal courage
and endurance, and secondly a modest demeanour in the young.
The boys had to go barefoot, were allowed only one garment to
wear throughout the year in heat and cold alike, and were
kept on short rations of food: they were encouraged to steal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
food, but, if they were caught, were severely beaten for not
having stolen cleverly<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>; and, if one of them complained to
his father that another boy had beaten him, the father was
thought to have disgraced himself if he did not give him a
sound thrashing in addition<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>. The young men always walked
silent with their eyes modestly fixed on the ground before
them; and from this behaviour you could no more seduce them
than you could a statue<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>. The great deference paid to age
is merely hinted at in this treatise<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> but it is well known from
other sources.</p>

<p>When the youths grew up to be men they were compelled
to dine at the common meal provided for them: and unless
they paid their contributions to its cost they lost the rights of
citizenship. Their military training no doubt still continued:
for the operations of warfare which the author describes were
such as to require every man in the army to be always familiar
with them from recent recollection<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>. Every Spartan was not
only compelled to concentrate his attention on military excellence,
but was completely cut off from all commercial pursuits
and even from agriculture<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>. Commerce and all useful arts
were left to the Periœci: the Spartan could practise none of
them without degradation. His expenditure consisted in his
contribution to the common meals and in the cost of maintaining
a house for his wife and daughters and his sons till
they were placed under the care of the warden of the boys.
His income was derived from his lands which were tilled by
Helots assigned to him by the State. The accumulation of
wealth was severely discouraged: the possession of gold or
silver was criminal and was punished with a fine: the currency
was made of iron and was so cumbrous that no one could
have much of it without the knowledge of all, since a quantity
worth ten minæ (£40 sterling) would demand large storage-room
and a waggon to remove it<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>.</p>

<p>As every Spartan was a soldier all his life long from attain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>ing
manhood till he was too old for service, the organisation of
the army must be counted among the important parts of the
Spartan institutions. At a great battle fought and won by the
Spartans in the year 418 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the number of Spartiatæ on
service was about three thousand one hundred. The force was
divided into six regiments of five or six hundred men, each
containing four smaller divisions, and sixteen smallest divisions
or companies, which last bore the name of <span lang="grc">ἐνωμοτίαι</span>, or bands
of sworn soldiers. Each regiment had its commander and so
had all its compartments down to the smallest: the commander
gave his orders to the officers next below him, and they to the
commanders of companies: and it was only from these last that
the orders reached the soldiers<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>. The success of the whole
system thus depended on the obedience of the lesser officers to
their commander, and above all on the efficiency and good
discipline of the companies or Enomoties.</p>

<p>The drill of each company was carried to the highest pitch
of perfection: this at least is clear from the description of their
evolutions given in the treatise from which I have so often
quoted<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>. The number of men in a company seems to have
been normally twenty-five, since two companies were sometimes
called a fifty<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>: on some occasions it might be thirty-two or
thirty-six. As it was usual at the beginning of a war to call
out all the Spartans who were below a certain age<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>, it is
probable that none but men of the same age were placed
together in a company, since in the absence of such an arrangement
the proclamation of war might have divided each company
into two parts, one part going to fight and the other staying at
home. And if each company consisted of equals in age we may
conjecture that when a Spartan attained the age of manhood
he was immediately sworn in as a member of a company, and
with that company he remained throughout his life unless he
had to be drafted into another company to fill a vacancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>On the march one company led the way and the others
followed in order. When an enemy came in sight, each
regiment was able by means of evolutions of companies to form
itself for battle in the dense array of the phalanx; and further
by varying the evolutions the phalanx was made to face in any
direction that was desired, and it was ensured that the front
rank was composed entirely of the very best of the warriors<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>.</p>

<p>The Spartan soldiers seem to have had no defensive armour
except a large brazen shield: their dress was of a bright red<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
colour, and probably consisted of a single large plaid which
could be fastened with a brooch at the shoulder<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>: for offensive
weapons they had a long spear and short sword<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>. A regiment
arranged in phalanx had a front rank of about sixty-four men
as in the great battle in 418 <span class="small">B.C.</span>: each of the ranks behind
contained the same number, and there were in some cases as
many as eight ranks<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>. For a body thus arranged the long
spear for thrusting was obviously the best weapon: but the
short sword was also needed whenever there was a close combat
between man and man.</p>

<p>III. We have already seen<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> that the Spartans in prehistoric
times lived under a system of government which I have
called dual heroic kingship: their political institutions were in
most respects the same as those of the other Greeks in the
heroic age, but they regularly had two kings reigning at the
same time, each being head by descent of one of the two royal
houses. After the establishment of the dual heroic kingship
but still in the prehistoric age the Spartans introduced further
modifications in their system of government: and since their
descendants, whether rightly or wrongly, believed that the wise
lawgiver Lycurgus had been the author of these changes, the
modified system of government is known as the constitution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Lycurgus. This celebrated constitution is defined in a <span lang="grc">ῥήτρα</span>
or solemn compact said to have been dictated to Lycurgus by
the Delphic priestess and accepted by the Spartans: Plutarch
has preserved a document which professes to be the original
text: and, though the pretensions of this document to extreme
antiquity are probably unfounded, there is no doubt that it
gives a truthful account of the government<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>. It orders Lycurgus
"to found a temple of Zeus Syllanius and Athena Syllania, to
divide the people into tribes (<span lang="grc">φυλαί</span>) and obes (<span lang="grc">ὠβαί</span>), to establish
a senate of elders, thirty in number with the commanders
(i.e. the kings), to hold assemblies at fixed times between
Babyca and Knakion, and so to propose measures and take
decisions on them: and that the commons (<span lang="grc">δᾶμος</span>, <span lang="grc">δῆμος</span>, the
whole of the Spartiatæ) should have (? the decision?)<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> and
authority." Thus the constitution of Lycurgus retained all the
three component parts of the system to which I have given the
name of dual kingship, the two kings, the council of elders, and
the assembly of the people: but it prescribed that the meetings
of the king and elders and people were to be held no longer
according to the caprice of the kings but at fixed times and
between two places which were both in the town of Sparta or
close to it: the council of elders was to consist of exactly thirty
members, the two kings being included in that number: and
the assembly of the people was to possess authority (<span lang="grc">κράτος</span>).</p>

<p>The powers that belonged severally to the kings to the
elders and to the assembly are not defined. But the constitution
was made in the age of the heroic monarchies and was
derived from a dual heroic kingship by the introduction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
slight alterations. We may accordingly assume that in the
system of Lycurgus, as in the government that preceded it, the
important right of initiating measures was intended to belong
exclusively to the kings and elders, and that the "authority"
reserved to the popular assembly was no more than a right of
voting Aye or No on proposals which the kings and elders
submitted to it. In making this assumption we shall moreover
be in agreement with Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>, who, either from such merely
probable reasoning as we can use or on the authority of some
writer who preceded him, states that the kings and elders alone
had the initiative. In course of time however the assembly
attempted to amend what was put before it or to initiate
proposals of its own, and a second enactment (<span lang="grc">ῥήτρα</span>) was made
to put a stop to its usurpations. From the stories of the wars
with Messenia we learn that the command in war was one of
the prerogatives of the kings.</p>

<p>The first historical Spartan is Theopompus, who was one of
the two kings at some time between 750 <span class="small">B.C.</span> and 650 <span class="small">B.C.</span> In
his reign three great events took place: (1) the Spartans waged
war against their neighbours the Messenians, defeated them,
and made either a partial or a complete conquest of their
country, (2) the general assembly of Spartan people was explicitly
declared subordinate to the council of elders, and (3) the
office of the Ephors or Overseers was created.</p>

<p>(1) Somewhere about 650 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the poet Tyrtæus was living
at Sparta and wrote the lines:</p>

<p class="center"><span lang="grc">Ἡμετέρῳ βασιλῆι, θεοῖσι φίλῳ Θεοπόμπῳ,<br />
ὃν διὰ Μεσσήνην εἵλομεν εὐρύχορον.</span></p>

<p>i.e. "To our king Theopompus beloved of the gods, to whom we
owed our conquest of the broad plains of Messenia<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>." The
subjugation of Messenia must have been a very difficult task:
the country like the other natural divisions of Greece is protected
by mountains and it was defended by a brave and
numerous race of Dorians. Tyrtæus tells us that one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
wars against Messenia was carried on continuously for nineteen
years<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>.</p>

<p>(2) We are informed by Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> that, long after the
establishment of the Lycurgean constitution, the assembly of
the Spartiatæ took to a practice of distorting and perverting
the resolutions laid before them by omitting or inserting clauses,
and therefore the reigning kings Polydorus and Theopompus
added to the constitution a new rule which enacted that "if the
people chose crookedly, the elders and the kings should have
the final decision<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>." Thus the general assembly was rendered
incapable of insisting on measures of its own initiation: though
it probably retained a right of veto on all measures which the
council might propose and was consulted whenever the state
had to decide whether it should undertake a great and important
war<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>.</p>

<p>(3) Plato (quoted by Plutarch) says that though Lycurgus
had established a constitution of mixed elements, yet the
Spartans after his time finding that their oligarchy (the kings
and the elders) was nevertheless too strong and was swelled
and puffed up with power and pride, set up the office of the
Ephors to be a bit in its mouth: and Aristotle says of Theopompus
that he reduced the extent of the kingly power by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
creation of the magistracy of the Ephors and adds "They say
that his wife asked him whether he was not ashamed to
transmit to his sons less kingly power than he had inherited,
and he replied: 'Not in the least: for the power will be the
more lasting<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>.'"</p>

<p>But I must pause for a moment: for there is a passage
in Herodotus which in giving a rapid enumeration of the
Lycurgean institutions counts the Ephors among them and is
therefore in conflict with the statements of Plato and Aristotle.
Herodotus was writing about 430 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, Plato 400-347 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and
Aristotle about 330 <span class="small">B.C.</span>: so that Herodotus is the oldest of the
three writers and, if other circumstances were equal, ought to
be preferred to the others. But in this case other circumstances
are not equal: for Plato and Aristotle make their statements
deliberately and emphatically: Herodotus does not, but throws
in his list of institutions as a sort of parenthesis, while he is
thinking about many other things, and paying less attention to
his parenthetic remark. These facts lead me to the opinion
that Plato and Aristotle give us the true version of the oldest
tradition and Herodotus does not: the opinion moreover is
strengthened by the fact that Aristotle appeals to a story which
must have been current long before his time and was probably
older than the days of Herodotus; and it is further supported
by the negative evidence of the <span lang="grc">ῥήτρα</span>, which in defining the
Lycurgean constitution says not a word about Ephors.</p>

<p>It is impossible to determine what was the original character
of the magistracy of the Ephors: we do not know what were
their functions, how they were appointed or elected, nor for
what term they held office: but, from the passages which have
just been referred to, it is certain that Plato and Aristotle
believed that the power acquired by the Ephors diminished
the power of the kings and the elders. The name Ephors or
Overseers implies that they exercised some kind of supervision
over the government or some part of it.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that the three important events of
the reign of Theopompus were in some way connected with one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
another. In the midst of a great war for the conquest of
Messenia, it might be especially inconvenient that the assembly
of the Spartiatæ should initiate proposals of its own: for the
men who made up the assembly were the very same who formed
the whole of the Spartan army. And again in the settlement
of the affairs of Messenia it was not desirable that the kings
and the council should be entirely uncontrolled, as they would
have been after the assembly had been deprived of the power
of initiating measures, if no Ephors had been appointed.</p>

<p>It is stated by Plutarch that the twenty-eight elders who
with the kings formed the council were elected by the general
assembly of the Spartans<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>: and the method of election which
he describes is so extremely primitive that it probably belongs
to the original constitution or dates from the times of Theopompus.
When a councillor died the best man among those
over sixty years of age was to be chosen to take his place.
The people came together in assembly: certain selected men
were shut up in a neighbouring building whence they could see
nothing: the candidates were brought one by one before the
assembly, but in an order which was unknown to the men in
the building, and each as he entered was greeted with shouting:
the men in the building decided that the cheering had been
loudest for the man who came first, or the man who came
second, or some other in the order: and the man, unknown to
themselves, for whom they thus pronounced, was proclaimed as
the new member of the council.</p>

<p>The parts then of the Spartan government from the time of
Theopompus onwards were the kings, the council of elders,
the Ephors, and the assembly of warriors. Until about 500 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
the chief power belonged to the kings or to the kings and the
council of elders: the kings had the active management and
direction of foreign affairs<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>.</p>

<p>About that time and soon afterwards we meet with several
reigns that might account for a diminution of the kingly power.
In one of the regal houses there were Cleomenes I. (519-491<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
<span class="small">B.C.</span>) and Pleistarchus (480-458 <span class="small">B.C.</span>): in the other
Leotychidas (491-461 <span class="small">B.C.</span>). Cleomenes contrived the unfair
deposition of Demaratus, was half insane for some time before
his death, and slew himself in a fit of madness. Pleistarchus
was a little child at the death of his father Leonidas the hero
of Thermopylæ: his guardian was Pausanias, who tried to
betray Sparta into the power of the Persian king. Leotychidas
was brought into royal power, without any sound title, by the
intrigues of Cleomenes. Whatever may have been the causes
of the decline of the kingly prerogative, it is certain that
between 500 <span class="small">B.C.</span> and 467 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the Ephors rose to supreme
power at Sparta: they sat in judgement on king Cleomenes I.
on an accusation of bribery, they imprisoned the regent
Pausanias (about 467 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) on suspicion of treason, and above
all, in the year 479 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, it was on their own sole responsibility
that they despatched the great armament to resist Mardonius
in Bœotia<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a>. The power which they then possessed they never
lost till the decline of Sparta in the third century <span class="small">B.C.</span>, except
perhaps during the reign of an unusually able king such as
Agesilaus (398-361 <span class="small">B.C.</span>).</p>

<p>It has already been remarked that in the period from
Theopompus to about 500 <span class="small">B.C.</span> we do not know how the Ephors
were appointed or elected: in the time of Aristotle (about
330 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) they were elected from the whole body of Spartan
citizens, and no doubt by the whole body of Spartan citizens<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>.
They must have been thus elected as early as the time of
Cleomenes I.: for if they had been appointed by the kings or
the council of elders they could not have gained that independence
which they then displayed.</p>

<p>During the period of their greatness (beginning about
480 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) the Ephors were a board of five<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> magistrates elected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
annually. One of them gave his name to the year<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>: they
received ambassadors and sometimes at least gave them an
answer<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>: they could, as we have seen, send out an armament to
a foreign war and fix what troops should go, and whenever it
chanced that the assembly of the Spartiatæ was called together
an Ephor presided over it and took the votes<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>.</p>

<p>The kings in time of peace were dignitaries without power:
at sacrificial feasts and athletic contests they took the seats of
honour and after a sacrifice the skins of the victims were their
perquisite: the state provided them with regular monthly
allowances of food: they superintended religious matters, and
settled what Spartan citizens should be the <span lang="grc">πρόξενοι</span> or befrienders
of visitors to Sparta from the various Greek states: and
they had jurisdiction about marriages of heiresses, public ways,
and adoption of children: but with these exceptions all control
of home affairs had passed from the kings to the Ephors<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>. In
time of war the kings were commanders of the Spartan armies,
and the history of Agesilaus shows that in this capacity they
might gain high distinction and influence: but the expeditions
of the Spartans were usually accompanied by some of the
Ephors<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>, who could afterwards report to their colleagues any
action of the commander which displeased them.</p>

<p>Until the beginning of the Peloponnesian war in 432 <span class="small">B.C.</span>,
it seems that the government, whether it was controlled by the
kings, the council, or the Ephors, was faithfully conducted for
the interests of the whole of the little community of the
Spartiatæ. We do not hear of the rulers living in luxury, nor
of inequalities or discontents among the Spartiatæ, nor of
emancipations of Helots. Twice only in the course of several
centuries we read that the Spartans made a new law<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>: in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
foreign policy they were unenterprising: and they seem to have
devoted themselves to the cultivation of the military virtues
enjoined by their traditions, and to looking after their interests
at home, which consisted largely in keeping down, degrading
and humiliating the Messenians and the other Helots.</p>

<p>IV. While the Spartans were waging their great war
against the Athenians (432-404 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) and afterwards when
they were enjoying the advantages which their success procured
for them, many alterations were gradually introduced in
their customs and government. Helots were emancipated for
service as soldiers: inequalities arose among the Spartiatæ,
some of them acquiring great fortunes as regulators (harmosts)
in foreign cities, others sinking to poverty and losing their civic
rights: and the Ephors used their time of office for the getting
of wealth and enjoyment of luxury.</p>

<p>Helots had been employed as light-armed soldiers attending
on the heavy-armed Spartiatæ as early as the battle of Platæa
in 479 <span class="small">B.C.</span>: in the first years of the Peloponnesian war some
of them had distinguished themselves in the field, and in the
eighth year of the war (in the beginning of 424 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) the
Spartans, fearing they might be dangerous, thought of sending
them on foreign service. This plan of removing them was not
carried into effect: but a proclamation was put out that those
Helots who were conscious of having done good service in the
war might apply for their freedom: two thousand were selected
and were emancipated with striking solemnities: but within a
short time most of them disappeared, no one knew how, by
secret assassination<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>. This first liberation of Helots ended in
treachery and murder: but afterwards emancipations were
frequently made in good faith. The men who were raised
from serfdom did not become Periœci but were known as
<span lang="grc">νεοδαμώδεις</span>, or "men resembling new commoners."</p>

<p>Bodies of Neodamodês are mentioned by Thucydides as
existing in the years 421, 418, 413, 412 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>: and in one
of the occasions where he speaks of Neodamodês and Helots
as serving together he explains the difference between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
two by remarking that "the word Neodamodês signifies that
freedom has been already acquired," thus proving for certain
that a Neodamodês was an emancipated Helot<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>. After the end
of the war the Neodamodês became more numerous: in the year
399 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the Spartans sent out a thousand under Thimbron
to Asia Minor at the request of the Asiatic Greek cities<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>.</p>

<p>In 398 or 397 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, before Agesilaus had reigned a whole
year, a conspiracy against the Spartan government was set on
foot by a man named Cinadon. Xenophon in his account of
its detection says that Cinadon was a young man and vigorous
in body and mind but was not one of the Equals (<span lang="grc">οὐ μέντοι τῶν
ὁμοίων</span>). When the informer was questioned by the Ephors,
he said Cinadon had expressed confidence that many of the
Helots, the Neodamodês, the Inferiors (<span lang="grc">οἱ ὑπομείονες</span>), and the
Periœci were in sympathy with his aims: for whenever men of
these classes talked about the Spartiatæ, they could not conceal
that they would like to eat them raw<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>. The story shows that
the Equals were the highest of all the classes at Sparta, and
that the Inferiors, being distinct from the Helots, the Neodamodês
and the Periœci, were men who had been Spartiatæ but
had lost their position. The difference between the Equals
and the Inferiors is but imperfectly known. Aristotle tells us
that any Spartan who was unable to pay his share of the cost
of the public mess-table was deprived of his rights as a citizen,
and many had thus been disfranchised<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>. From this we may
infer that anyone who sank into the ranks of the Inferiors lost
not only his vote in the assembly, which was of little value, as
the assemblies were not influential, but also his right of being
trained as a Spartan: hence he would have but a poor chance
of rising to military distinction or of obtaining any position of
importance.</p>

<p>When the Peloponnesian war ended in 404 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, the cities
of Asia and the Ægean sea came under the power of Sparta.
To each city a harmost or regulator was sent to establish an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
oligarchical government consisting usually of a decarchy or
board of ten citizens distinguished for servility towards the
Spartans and readiness to punish any sign of patriotic spirit
with death or banishment and confiscation. Besides the harmosts,
military detachments were sent to enforce the wishes of
the Spartans in their new possessions: both the harmosts and
the military commanders were harsh governors, and some of
them amassed large fortunes by extortion<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>. They took home the
wealth that they had acquired and thus introduced the inequalities
among the Spartiatæ which were so conspicuous and
so invidious in the time of Cinadon.</p>

<p>The supremacy which the Spartans acquired in 404 <span class="small">B.C.</span> was
lost again in 371 <span class="small">B.C.</span> In that year an army with which they
invaded Bœotia was severely defeated by the Thebans under
Epaminondas; the victorious general marched into the Peloponnesus,
deprived the Spartans of Messenia, and, summoning from
all parts the descendants of Messenians who had gone into exile,
established them as an independent people in the new city of
Messenê on the site of the old stronghold of Ithomê. At the
same time he founded the Arcadian city of Megalê Polis (in
Latin Megalopolis) to bar the way between the Spartans and
their old allies the Eleians: and in the year 369 <span class="small">B.C.</span> he ensured
the permanence of his work by winning the decisive battle of
Mantineia. The Spartans were reduced lower than they had
been for two centuries: but adversity did not restore them to
what they had been before the days of their prosperity. The
number of men possessed of wealth, small already, steadily
became smaller, so that in the reign of Agis IV. (about 243 <span class="small">B.C.</span>)
the whole number of the Spartiatæ did not exceed seven
hundred; of these only about a hundred were landowners, and
the rest were reduced to poverty and distress<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>.</p>

<p>The office of the Ephors shared in the general deterioration
of the Spartan commonwealth, and Aristotle (writing about
330 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) speaks of it with some severity. We can indeed see
from his remarks that access to the office was not obtained by
bribery, for very poor citizens were frequently chosen: the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
election was conducted under a system which seemed to him
very puerile, but which did not close the door to poverty.
On the other hand the Ephors when in office frequently accepted
bribes: and he says that on one occasion they did all that
in them lay towards the ruin of the state. They often spent
the wealth that they got by such dishonest means in leading
a life of extreme self-indulgence, in strong contrast with the
hardships which the poorer citizens endured<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>.</p>

<p>We may now sum up the results of our observations of the
Spartans and their institutions. From the earliest times they
devoted themselves to acquiring and cultivating those qualities
which would enable them to excel as a people of conquerors
and of slave-owners: but in doing this they lost most of the
other virtues, and especially the qualities which make intelligent
citizens. There were few political questions in which the
Spartans took any interest: they did not make new laws; they
had no commerce, no gold or silver except in the treasury of
the state: the only subjects debated in their assemblies were
questions of war, peace, alliances, disputed successions to the
throne, and the like: so that the assembly did not meet save
when such questions arose, or when one of the annual elections
of Ephors came round. They did not even care what
men were set over them as rulers: their method of electing
Ephors was childish, and the elections are generally if not
always passed over in silence by the historians. Nor is their
indifference surprising: for their real ruler was, not the Ephors
nor any living men, but their rigid system of custom and
discipline: and under that system it mattered little which of
them was in command and which had to obey, since nearly
every Spartan was competent to issue such orders as custom and
usage dictated, and every other Spartan was prepared to obey
them.</p>

<p>If this estimate is a just one, it follows that the really
important part of the Spartan institutions was not the political
part but the disciplinary: that their discipline destroyed their
capacity for political activity: that the Spartans from the age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
of Theopompus till the Peloponnesian war were rather a military
order than a political body: and that they and their
institutions cannot be very interesting or instructive to students
of Politics, except as showing how a community, which was
originally political, may lose the characteristics by which political
communities are distinguished.</p>

<p>After the Peloponnesian war the Spartans got access to rich
spoil at a distance from their own country and began to think
less of their common interests as slave-owners at home, than of
their individual hopes of plundering the inhabitants of the
cities of Asia Minor. In consequence many of the Helots were
emancipated to serve as soldiers in foreign war, and the intensity
of the oppression of the rest was probably diminished:
while on the other hand each individual Spartan acted no
longer for the common good of the Spartiatæ but for the sole
good of himself, and the government was conducted in the
interest not of the whole ruling caste but of that smaller
number among them who had been successful in enriching
themselves.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="ph">THE GREEK CITIES.</p>


<p>I have already stated that between 650 <span class="small">B.C.</span> and 338 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
the Greek communities with the exception of Sparta are to be
classed as city states, or communities in which a walled city is of
supreme importance and the rural districts count for very little.
It seems right to place the beginning of the city states so early
as 650 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, because at that time three out of the four communities
of which we have records were ruled oppressively by
bodies of magnates who lived in the cities or close to them, and
who owed their power to the protection of the city walls and to
the facilities for concerted action which they gained from living
close to a common centre. It must however be admitted that
the evidence of the great importance of the cities is not so clear
at the early date which I have named as it is a century later,
in the age of the tyrants.</p>

<p>The examination of the political institutions of the Greek
cities will be divided into four parts: I. The early aristocracies
and oligarchies; II. The tyrannies; III. The democracies and
the later oligarchies; IV. The conquest of Greece by Macedonia.</p>


<h3>I. <i>The early aristocracies and oligarchies.</i></h3>

<p>Before the year 650 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the heroic monarchies had ceased
to exist in all the more important Greek peoples and other
governments had taken their place. Of the process of the
change from the old tribal system to other systems we have no
contemporary records in any case: and traditions even of a later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
date are absent except in regard to Corinth, Megara, Athens
and Argos.</p>

<p>At Corinth it is said that in 745 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the members of the
royal family, two hundred in number, deposed the king
Aristomenes, and took the control of the state into their own
possession, electing one of their own number every year to act
as president and discharge the functions of king. They were
distinguished by their descent from king Bacchis, were known
as the Bacchiadæ, and in order to keep themselves a distinct
caste they forbade all members of their family to marry any one
but a descendant of Bacchis. In 655 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, after they had ruled
for ninety years, their government was selfish and oppressive<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>.</p>

<p>At Megara we know only that the government was in the
hands of certain rich families, and that eventually their oppressive
rule provoked the common folk under the leadership of a
man named Theagenes to rise against them and overthrow
them<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>.</p>

<p>At Athens the nobles gradually deprived the king of his
power and prerogatives: and from a date somewhere between
700 <span class="small">B.C.</span> and 650 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the government was controlled by a
permanent council of nobles, and its details were managed by
nine archons or administrators, who were selected yearly by the
council<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a>. The council consisted of those who were serving or
had served the office of archons<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>, so that the council in selecting
new archons also filled up vacancies in its own numbers: among
the nine magistrates the first in rank was The Archon, who
gave his name to his year of office: the second was the Archon
Basileus, who performed the religious rites: the third was the
Polemarch, who commanded in war: the other six were called
Thesmothetæ, and probably attended to judicial business<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>. The
nobles then from 650 <span class="small">B.C.</span> or earlier were in exclusive possession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
of power: how they used it when first they got it, is not
recorded: by 600 <span class="small">B.C.</span> they were employing it selfishly for the
interests of their class.</p>

<p>The first truly historical Athenian is Draco, who, about
620 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, collected the customary law of Athens and formed it,
together with some provisions of his own, into a written code of
legal regulations. The newly recovered Aristotelian treatise
on the constitution of Athens contains a passage which also
attributes to him some very important changes in the structure
of the government<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>: but, as this passage was certainly either
not known or not accepted as genuine by Plutarch in the first
century <span class="small">A.D.</span> and Pollux in the second century, though they
were well acquainted with Aristotle's treatise, it seems impossible
to regard it as an original part of the work<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>.</p>

<p>Whether Draco did or did not attempt to reform the
government, he did not put an end to the oppressive practices
of the nobles and the wealthy. They took advantage of the
harsh laws relating to debt, to deprive the poorer freemen of
their lands or to reduce them to slavery: but the poor showed
so much inclination for fighting that their oppressors were
alarmed. In the year 594 <span class="small">B.C.</span> it was agreed by both the
contending classes that Solon should be elected archon and
entrusted with power to deal with the existing discontents and
to make a new form of government. He cancelled all existing
debts, restored to liberty those who had been enslaved, altered
the law in regard to security for debt, and then attempted to
remedy the defects of the political system.</p>

<p>Solon devised a moderate system of popular government of
the kind to which Aristotle afterwards gave the name of Polity.
It was popular, since the mass of the citizens had a controlling
power: but it was moderate, because no class had opportunities
for governing in its own interest. His new institutions were
the <span lang="grc">δικαστήρια</span> or popular law-courts, the <span lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</span> or assembly
of citizens, the <span lang="grc">βουλή</span> or council of four hundred, and certain
regulations which made eligibility to office depend on wealth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
The archons kept their titles and functions: the permanent
council of ex-archons, henceforth known as the council of the
Arêus Pagus (in Latin Areopagus), survived with diminished
authority.</p>

<p>The <span lang="grc">δικαστήρια</span> were courts in which large bodies of citizens
sat as judges or jurymen: and Athenian citizens of all classes,
including the Thetes or labourers for hire, were qualified to
serve in them. The extent of their jurisdiction is not precisely
known: but as they were empowered to hear appeals from the
decisions of all magistrates, they had the final judgement in
questions of the greatest importance: and as the laws were
imperfect or uncertain, they could often be a law to themselves.
Under the oligarchy there had been no general assembly of
citizens or it had been as powerless as the common folk in an
<span lang="grc">ἀγορή</span> of the Homeric age: Solon ordered all citizens to come
together yearly in assembly for the election of archons. The
choice however of the archons was conducted by a process that
was not purely elective: each of the four ancient tribes, into
which the Athenian families were divided, elected from among
the richest class of citizens ten candidates for the office, and,
from the forty thus chosen, nine were taken by drawing lots.
As Solon ordered that the laws which he had made should
continue in force for a hundred years, we may infer that he
intended that the assembly should for the present do little or
nothing in the way of law making: but, in case it should be
inclined towards unwise innovations, he established as a check
upon it his <span lang="grc">βουλή</span> or council of four hundred. To make up this
council he selected a hundred men from each of the four tribes;
and, to give it a restraining power, he ordered that no proposal
should be brought before the assembly till the council had
approved it. His rules for eligibility to office depended on a
division of the citizens into four classes according to their
wealth. The richest class were the Pentacosiomedimni, whose
lands yielded in the year not less than five hundred medimni
(about seven hundred bushels) in aggregate produce of corn, oil
and wine: next came the Hippeis, who had three hundred
medimni yearly and could equip and maintain a horseman for
warfare: then the Zeugitæ, who had two hundred medimni and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
kept a yoke of oxen: and lastly the Thetes, who were the
poorest class and worked for hire. The richest class were alone
eligible to the archonship and the treasurership: the second
and third class could hold lesser offices suitable to their condition:
and the Thetes alone were incapable of holding places
in the administration<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>.</p>

<p>The constitution of Solon remained in full working order
for only three or four years: then there arose violent contests
about the appointment of archons, which show that the immediate
effect of his changes had been to transfer the chief
power to the nine magistrates<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>. The turbulence of factions
made it impossible to enforce some parts of his constitution:
but other parts of it were probably observed, and the whole
served as a foundation for Cleisthenes to build upon. It is
probable that the strife of classes which spoiled the working
of Solon's institutions led to the restoration of some kind of
oligarchy: for if it was not so, it is hard to account for the
readiness of the poor citizens to accede to the wishes of the
demagogue Pisistratus.</p>

<p>The prevalence of oligarchical governments in the Greek
cities of Sicily at an early stage of their career is noticed by
Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>: the existence of similar governments in the Greek
cities generally in the same stage of their progress may fairly
be inferred from the silence of historians.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that none of the traditions about the
governments of the nobles in the Greek cities of the seventh
century <span class="small">B.C.</span> tell us anything about their behaviour or character
when first they rose to power. From the probabilities of the
case however we may conjecture that at first they were good
governments and used their power well: they supplanted the
long-established heroic monarchies, and could not have succeeded
in such an achievement unless they had had merits of
their own. It seems then that during the first part of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
existence they ought to be called aristocracies rather than
oligarchies: for an aristocracy is a government conducted by
the few best men in a community for the best interests of the
whole community, while an oligarchy is a government conducted
by a few for their own selfish interests. From what has been
already stated about the governments of the nobles in the later
part of their careers, it will be seen that oligarchy is a name
which suits them precisely.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the chapter it was remarked that the
nobles lived in the cities or close beside them, and owed their
power to the protection of the city walls and to the facilities for
concerted action which they gained from living close to a
common centre: and it is now necessary to give authorities for
the statement. Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> speaks of the oligarchy at Athens as
<span lang="grc">οἱ πεδιακοί</span>, or inhabitants of <span lang="grc">τὸ πεδίον</span>, a little tract of level
ground near Athens, Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> calls them <span lang="grc">πεδιεῖς</span>in exactly the
same sense, and the Etymologicum Magnum<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> a much later
authority says the Eupatridæ lived in the city of Athens itself.
The oligarchy at Megara were overthrown by Theagenes: and
he succeeded in overthrowing them by catching them while
they were taking their horses and cattle to graze beside the
river<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a>:&mdash;a fact which shows that when they went out into the
open country they were caught at a disadvantage, and implies
that they habitually lived behind defences. As to the Bacchiadæ
at Corinth there is not any statement that they lived in the
city, but Herodotus in a story which will be told presently
explains carefully that a certain Corinthian who was not one
of the ruling caste did not live in the city but in a <span lang="grc">δῆμος</span> or
place in the open country. The evidence for my proposition
that at Athens, Megara and Corinth the cities as distinct from
the open country were of great importance is not, I confess,
very conclusive: but I have thought it sufficient to justify me
in regarding the communities which lived at those places as
city states and not as tribes.</p>

<p>At Argos the course of events was not the same as in those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
cities of which I have spoken. The Argive monarchy, as we have
seen<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>, was not abolished but continued to exist so late as 480 <span class="small">B.C.</span>:
the king however was not a great power in the state: for we do
not hear of any doings of any of the kings. On the other hand,
the fact that the monarchy was permitted to survive shows
clearly that there was no oligarchy at Argos so violent and exclusive
as the rule of the Bacchiadæ at Corinth or the Eupatridæ
at Athens. Since then supreme power did not belong either to
the king or to the nobles, power must have been in some way
divided, so that Argos had a mixed or balanced form of government:
and this fact is of some interest, since it adds something
to the slight resemblance between Argos and Rome which has
been already noticed, by showing that in these two cities forms
of government succeeded one another in the same order. In
each there was first a strong monarchy: next an excessively
strong monarchy or tyranny: and afterwards a mixed or balanced
form of government. At Rome the three stages are marked by
Servius Tullius, by Tarquin the Proud, and by the division of
power between patricians and plebeians: at Argos by the early
Doric kings, by Pheidon, and by the mixed form of government
which was established after the decline of his power.</p>


<h3>II. <i>The Tyrannies.</i></h3>

<p>The way in which the oligarchic governments were destroyed
is illustrated by the successful enterprise of Pisistratus
at Athens: the character of the despotisms which succeeded
them by the history of Cypselus and Periander, tyrants of
Corinth from 655 <span class="small">B.C.</span> to 585 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and by the reigns of Pisistratus
and his son.</p>

<p>The story of the origin of the Corinthian tyranny, as told by
Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>, begins when Corinth was ruled by the oligarchy of
the Bacchiadæ. It was, as we have already seen, the custom of
this family to forbid their children to marry any but a Bacchiad.
But one of them had a lame daughter named Labda, and, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
none of the Bacchiad princes would marry her, she was given to
Eetion who was below the caste. Eetion had also another wife:
Labda had a child, but the other wife had none, and Eetion,
being discontented, sent to consult the Delphic oracle. The
priestess took no notice of what he asked but declared that
Labda should bear another son who should be an important
person. The Bacchiadæ heard of the oracle, held counsel what
they should do, and appointed ten men of their own number to
go to the village where Eetion lived and to destroy the child.
The ten men came to the house, went into the court and asked
for the new-born infant: Labda thinking they had come out of
kindness to congratulate Eetion, brought out her child and put
it in the hands of one of the visitors. They had arranged that
the first of them that got hold of it should dash it on the
ground: but it chanced, by luck sent from the gods, that the
child smiled on the man who had received it: he took notice of
this, and could not perform the murder, but passed on the child
to the second man, and the second to the third, and so the child
was passed round all ten and none had the heart to slay it.
They gave it back to the mother and went outside the house,
reproached one another for soft-heartedness, and resolved to go
back and carry out their commission. But it was fated that
from the seed of Eetion mischief should grow up for Corinth:
Labda standing by the door heard their words, and hid the
child in a <span lang="grc">κυψέλη</span> or chest: his life was saved, he received the
name of Cypselus (<span lang="grc">Κύψελος</span>), and when he was a man overpowered
the Bacchiadæ, and established himself as tyrant. He
drove many of the Corinthians into exile, reduced many to
penury, and put to death many more. After a reign of thirty
years he was succeeded by his son. Periander, the new tyrant,
at first governed gently: but after he had sent an envoy to
Thrasybulus, tyrant of Miletus, to ask how he could best secure
his power, and had learned from the envoy on his return that
Thrasybulus had replied only by going into a plot of standing
corn and lopping off the tallest ears, he began to destroy the
most distinguished citizens and became a more murderous
oppressor than Cypselus had been.</p>

<p>The character of Periander's government is exemplified in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
the stories of the spoiling of the Corinthian women and the
seizure of the Corcyræan boys.</p>

<p>Among those whom Periander killed was his wife Melissa:
a treasure had been committed to her keeping by a friend, and
Periander after he had killed her regretted that he had not first
learned from her where it was concealed. To repair his error
he sent to the necromantic oracle at Acheron to question her
ghost. Melissa appeared, but refused to say where the treasure
was, complaining of being cold and naked, since the clothing
buried in her tomb was no good to her because it had not been
burned. Periander issued a proclamation inviting all the
Corinthian women to a great festival at the Heræum: and when
they came in their best attire, the spearmen surrounded them
and stripped them of their clothes and jewels, which Periander
heaped together in a pit and burned as an offering, accompanied
by his prayers, to Melissa. Her ghost was propitiated, and,
appearing a second time, revealed the place where she had hid
the treasure.</p>

<p>The father of Melissa was Procles tyrant of Epidaurus.
The two sons of Periander and Melissa had no suspicion how
their mother's death had occurred, till at the ages of eighteen
and seventeen they visited their grandfather at Epidaurus.
When the visit was at an end, and Procles was bidding them
farewell, he remarked "I suppose you know, boys, who killed
your mother?" The elder son gave no heed to this: the
younger, Lycophron, after his return to his home at Corinth,
would not speak to Periander, and was accordingly driven out
of his house and went to stay with friends in the city. Periander
forbade them to show him hospitality; and at last, to force his
son to return home, proclaimed that any one who spoke to him
must pay a fine to Apollo. Lycophron, driven from the houses
of his friends, did not go home but went to sleep in the open
air under the porticoes. After this had gone on three nights,
Periander went himself and tried to talk his son over: but got
no answer except "You have incurred the fine to Apollo by
speaking to me." Periander, seeing no other way of getting
Lycophron out of his sight, sent him to rule over Corcyra, which
was a colony of Corinth and, contrary to the usual practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
among the Greeks, remained under the government of the
mother city. When Lycophron had lived long in Corcyra,
Periander grew old and unequal to the task of ruling the
Corinthians, and besought Lycophron to come and be tyrant
at Corinth, promising that he himself would go to Corcyra.
Lycophron, after much persuasion, was brought to consent, but
the Corcyræans did not like the prospect of the change and to
make it impossible put Lycophron to death. The vengeance of
Periander was worthy of a tyrant: he seized three hundred
boys of the best families in Corcyra and shipped them off for
Sardis to be made slaves and eunuchs to Asiatics and barbarians:
the commanders however of the ships which carried
them were obliged to touch at Samos, and the boys were
enabled to take sanctuary and were afterwards through the
kindness of the Samians restored to their parents in Corcyra.</p>

<p>At Athens, in the year 560 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, the chief contending parties
were the rich men of the plain, the men of the sea-shore,
and the poor men of the hill country. Pisistratus, a young
Athenian who had twice won military distinction, having formed
a body of partisans and declared himself to be the leader of the
men of the hill country, obtained tyrannical power over Attica
by means of a trick. He drove into Athens in a chariot drawn
by a pair of mules, both he and his mules bleeding from many
wounds, which had been inflicted with his own hands. The
people were already assembled or came together to meet him.
He addressed them and said he had been driving into the
country and had been attacked by his political opponents: and
went on to request them that he might have some men to
protect him. A resolution granting his request was proposed
by Aristion and accepted by the assembly: before long he and
his guard of club men seized the Acropolis and he became
tyrant. Twice Pisistratus was expelled from Attica in consequence
of rebellions stirred up by Megacles, the head of the
noble house of the Alcmæonidæ, and twice he recovered his
despotic power. After his first expulsion, he bade a certain
woman named Phyê of tall stature and graceful figure to array
herself in a splendid suit of complete armour and drive in a
chariot into the Acropolis: he sent heralds before her to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
proclamation "O Athenians, give good welcome to Pisistratus:
ye see that the goddess Athenê has honoured him above all
men, and is herself leading him home into her own Acropolis."
The people in the city were thus persuaded that Phyê was the
goddess Athenê, and were induced to give good welcome to
Pisistratus: he became master of the Acropolis, and his despotic
power was re-established. After his second expulsion, he spent
ten years in exile: at the end of that time he had contrived to
amass large sums of money, and had gained the adherence of a
strong force of mercenary troops and soldiers of fortune. At
the head of his army he landed in Attica and began reducing
the country: the Athenians marched out to oppose him but
showed no vigour in their resistance: and before long he was
admitted within the city. Then for the first time his tyranny
rooted itself firmly in the soil. Hitherto his government had
been mild and orderly: he had never tried to meddle with the
habits and home life of his subjects: and, as neither of his
attempts to recover his power had been vigorously resisted, his
rule must have been regarded with favour by a large part of
the Athenians. Now he began to rely on force and fear alone
for the maintenance of his authority. He surrounded himself
with a strong body of foreign mercenaries: many of the citizens
from fear of him went into exile: and those who remained in
Attica, in case they fell under any suspicion, were compelled to
deliver their children into his charge as hostages for their good
behaviour. And yet, even in this period when his government
was most oppressive, he never put a stop to the election by the
citizens of the nine yearly archons according to the ancient
constitution, though he took care that one of the archons should
always be a member of his own family<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>. At his death in
527 <span class="small">B.C.</span> he was succeeded by his son Hippias, who for some
years imitated the policy of his father by tolerating the maintenance
of some of the popular institutions while he kept the
substance of power in his own hands. After the unsuccessful
conspiracy of Harmodius and Aristogeiton in 514 <span class="small">B.C.</span> his rule
became harsh and repressive<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>The fall of the Athenian tyranny was brought about through
a foreign intervention. The wealthy family of the Alcmæonidæ
had been forced at the last restoration of Pisistratus to leave
Athens and go into exile. It chanced that the great temple
of Apollo at Delphi had been destroyed by fire, and the
Amphictyonic council, composed of delegates from the Hellenic
races, making great efforts had obtained money enough to rebuild
it. The Alcmæonidæ contracted with the Amphictyonic council
that they would for a certain sum restore the temple: and
to acquire influence with the Delphic priestess they performed
the task with splendour far exceeding what was required of
them. After this, whenever the oracle was consulted by the
Spartan state or by any Spartan, the answer was always the
same "Set Athens free." In 510 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the Spartans resolved to
obey the commands of the god: the king Cleomenes was sent
to Athens in command of a Spartan army, Hippias was expelled,
the exiles restored, and the Athenians were free to establish
any constitution that they might desire<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>.</p>

<p>It was probably impossible for a Greek city, in the period
when democracy was unthought of, to overthrow an oligarchy
without setting up a tyranny in its stead. Tyrannies are found
in all parts of the Hellenic world in or about the sixth century
<span class="small">B.C.</span>: at Sicyon, Megara, Epidaurus, in the island of Samos, at
Mitylenê in Lesbos, in all the cities of Asia Minor, in Italy at
Rhegium, and in Sicily at Agrigentum, Zanclê, Himera, Selinus,
Gela and Leontini<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>. Most of the tyrants began their ambitious
careers, as Pisistratus began his, by flattering the poor and
oppressed classes and professing to be champions of liberty<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>:
some of them however started with being hereditary kings
possessing limited prerogatives[139], others were high officers of
state[139], or were members of an oligarchy<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a>: but all alike were
usurpers of absolute power and found it necessary eventually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
to maintain themselves in power by employing a body guard of
foreign mercenaries<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>. Pheidon of Argos, as I have already
remarked, cannot properly be counted among the <span lang="grc">τύραννοι</span>: the
same may be said of Pittacus of Mitylenê with still greater
confidence: for Pittacus was in no sense a usurper, but was
deliberately chosen as Æsymnetes or permanent dictator and
endowed with absolute power by a vote of the people<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>. If
Pittacus were counted as a tyrant, Solon would have to be
counted as a tyrant also: for the powers conferred on the two
men were the same, and were bestowed on them for the same
purposes and by the same authority and procedure.</p>

<p>The establishment of tyrants, or usurpers of absolute
power, was necessary to the development of most of the Greek
states, because nothing else would have sufficed to destroy the
oppressive power of the nobles: and many of the new rulers for
a time governed well and were respected by their subjects.
All however in time became selfish and cruel, and being
detested by their countrymen were forced to hire foreign
mercenaries to protect them. But no precaution on the part
of the tyrants could avail them for long in the face of the
general abhorrence with which they were regarded. Their
dynasties usually lasted only for one or two generations: the
most long-lived of all was that of the Orthagoridæ at Sicyon
which lasted a hundred years<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>.</p>

<p>The feelings with which the memory of the tyrants was
regarded in the latter part of the fifth century <span class="small">B.C.</span> when
Herodotus wrote his history are shown by a speech which he
puts in the mouth of a Corinthian named Sosicles. The
Spartans at some time between 510 <span class="small">B.C.</span> and 490 <span class="small">B.C.</span> conceived
a project of reinstating at Athens the tyrant Hippias whom
they had helped to dethrone, and requested their allies to send
ambassadors to discuss the matter. The envoys of all the states
disliked the proposal: it was Sosicles who expressed the feelings
of all. "Surely" he said "the heaven shall be set below the
earth, and the earth raised above the heaven, and men shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
have their habitation in the sea and the fishes live on dry land,
if ye, O Lacedæmonians, are preparing to destroy equal governments
and to bring the cities of Greece under the rule of
tyrannies, which of all things in the world are the wickedest and
bloodiest. If indeed ye think it good for cities to be ruled by
tyrants, ye should first set a tyrant over yourselves, and then
seek to do the like for your neighbours: for if ye had experienced,
as we have, what a tyrant is, ye would bring before
us sounder opinions on the subject than those that ye have now
declared<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>." He enforced his opinions by telling a large part of
the story of Cypselus and Periander: and the effect of his words
was such that the envoys at the congress declared their agreement
with them and the Spartans had to abandon all thought
of the restoration of the Athenian tyranny.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that in the age of the tyrants the
Greek communities were city states, or communities in which a
walled city is of supreme importance and the rural districts are
of comparatively little moment. In the case of Athens, the
story of Pisistratus affords conclusive evidence: for in it we can
observe three times over that, so long as his influence or
authority extended only to the rural districts, he was but an
aspirant to sovereignty: but, as soon as he was master of the
city, he was established as tyrant. And in the other Greek
communities tyrannies were upheld by body guards of foreign
mercenaries: and this could hardly have taken place if there
had not been in each community a single fortified city of such
importance that a body guard by occupying it could dominate
the whole country.</p>

<p>Between the tyrants of the Greek cities and the tyrants of
the Italian cities of the middle ages there is a close resemblance:
but the tyrants, both Greek and Italian, differ in one
most important particular from all monarchs who have ruled
over empires, tribes or nations. In an empire, a tribe or a
nation the power of a monarch always has some visible utility:
in an empire he holds the whole structure together: in a tribe
or nation he repels foreign attack or leads his subjects to assail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
their neighbours: and above all, if his tribe or nation is successful
and annexes new territory, he is supremely useful in
amalgamating the people of the new territory with his old
subjects. To a tyrant all these kinds of usefulness were impossible:
the community that he ruled was too small to need
holding together: it was too well protected by its mountain
bulwarks and city walls to fear much hurt from hostile invasion:
it could not hope to conquer neighbours whose defences were as
strong as its own: and it did not acquire new subjects. There
was, as we have seen, one momentous service which the tyrants
could and did perform for their cities, and that was to put down
the oligarchies and to ensure that they did not rise again: but,
when once this task was performed, there was little else that
they could do, and their power became a mere political survival,
or an institution which exists not because it is useful but
because it has existed and has not yet been removed.</p>


<h3>III. <i>The Democracies and the Later Oligarchies.</i></h3>

<p>By the year 500 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the tyrannies had disappeared from
Greece proper from Asia Minor and from the Ægean sea: and
from about that time democracies and oligarchies&mdash;the rule of
the many poor and the rule of the few rich&mdash;succeeded one
another alternately in most of the cities till the battle of
Chæroneia in 338 <span class="small">B.C.</span> put an end to the independence of the
Greeks. My examples both of democracy and of oligarchy will
all be taken from the history of Athens: for the march of
events at Athens has been illuminated for us by Thucydides,
Aristophanes, Xenophon, Aristotle, Demosthenes and other
great writers and orators, while of the other Greek cities we
have no knowledge beyond what can be derived from a few
fragmentary notices. At Athens the period which we are
considering was most unequally divided between democracy and
oligarchy: the government was oligarchic only for four months
in 411 <span class="small">B.C.</span> and for eight months in 404 <span class="small">B.C.</span>; throughout the
rest of the time, a duration of nearly two centuries, it was
steadily democratic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>My sketch of democracy and oligarchy as exemplified in
Athenian history will be divided into five parts: (1) Moderate
popular government 508 <span class="small">B.C.</span>-480 <span class="small">B.C.</span> (2) The changes between
480 <span class="small">B.C.</span> and 432 <span class="small">B.C.</span> (3) Democracy during the Peloponnesian
war 432 <span class="small">B.C.</span>-404 <span class="small">B.C.</span> (4) Democracy after the Peloponnesian
war 404 <span class="small">B.C.</span>-338 <span class="small">B.C.</span> (5) Oligarchies in 411 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
and in 404 <span class="small">B.C.</span></p>


<h4>1. <i>Moderate popular government under the Cleisthenean
constitution</i> 508 <span class="small">B.C.</span>-480 <span class="small">B.C.</span></h4>

<p>After the expulsion of Hippias a contest for power arose
between Isagoras and Cleisthenes. Isagoras was a friend of the
expelled tyrant: Cleisthenes, finding that he was getting
worsted, made an alliance with the poorer classes and within
three years after the exile of Hippias he was victorious. Cleisthenes,
like Solon, devised a new system of government: and
his system, like Solon's, was popular but moderate, and formed
an instance of what Aristotle called Polity. He desired to grant
the rights of citizenship to certain classes which did not possess
them: and to this end he deprived the four old Ionic tribes of
all political significance: for, as a tribe contained three <span lang="grc">φρατρίαι</span>
or brotherhoods, and each <span lang="grc">φρατρία</span>&mdash;at least theoretically&mdash;contained
thirty kindreds, each tribe was a close corporation
consisting of a fourth part of the families of the Athenian
citizens and would resist the intrusion of new members<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>. He
divided the people, for political purposes, into ten tribes constructed
on a new principle and defined not as containing
certain families but as dwelling in certain demes or villages:
and he enrolled in these tribes, and thereby in the list of
citizens, a large number of men who resided in Attica, but were
not of pure Attic descent<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a>. It may be that each of the old
tribes had formed a rallying point for one of those factions which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
had produced the dissensions between localities and classes in
the time before Pisistratus: for Cleisthenes took care in his
new division of the citizens that the demes which formed a
tribe should not lie all in one district but some of them should
be urban or suburban, some situated in the inland parts, and
others along the shore<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>.</p>

<p>The whole body of Athenian citizens, greatly enlarged by
the inclusion of the new citizens, formed the <span lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</span>, or
general assembly in the constitution of Cleisthenes. The
importance of the meetings of the assembly in the time before
Marathon (490 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) is proved by a passage in Herodotus in
which he attributes the military successes of the Athenians in
their wars with the Bœotians and Chalcidæans between 500 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
and 490 <span class="small">B.C.</span> to their newly acquired right of free and equal
speech<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a>: for the right of free speech could not have produced
such effects unless it were used in a general assembly.</p>

<p>The other parts of the Cleisthenean constitution have to do
with the organisation of the army and of the council, with a
strange and novel process known as ostracism, and with local
government within the demes.</p>

<p>The military force under Pisistratus and his son had consisted
of foreign mercenaries: Cleisthenes established an army
of citizens. Each tribe furnished a brigade serving under the
general whom the tribe had elected: at Marathon in 490 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
the right wing was formed by a body of troops under the
Polemarch and then from right to left the ten tribal brigades
were marshalled in order each under its own general<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a>.</p>

<p>The number of the council, which Solon had fixed at four
hundred, was raised by Cleisthenes to five hundred, fifty
councillors being taken from each tribe<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>. In the time of
the Peloponnesian war, (as will be shown further on,) the
council of five hundred was a committee of citizens entrusted
with the duty of controlling the proceedings of the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
assembly: it considered resolutions and projects of law before
they were submitted to the assembled people: the fifty councillors
of each tribe enjoyed for a tenth part of the year the
dignity of <span lang="grc">πρυτάνεις</span> or presiding officers, both in the council
and in the general assembly, and the name <span lang="grc">πρυτανεία</span> was
applied both to their right of presidency and to the thirty-five
or thirty-six days for which they possessed it: and, as the
assembly met often and had much business to attend to, such a
committee was obviously necessary. The records of the age of
Cleisthenes give no details about the doings of the assembly
and the council: but the activity of the assembly, as we have
already seen, began in that age, and it is natural to suppose
that some of the later functions and organisation of the council
may be referred back to this time. The opinion is confirmed
by a piece of evidence from Plutarch who states incidentally
that in 490 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the tribe Æantis was the presiding tribe in
the assembly which resolved that the Athenians should march
out to resist the invader Darius<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a>. It is probable that under
the Cleisthenean constitution the assembly met once in each
prytany.</p>

<p>The process of ostracism was devised to guard the state
against any future demagogue who might, like Pisistratus,
aspire to make himself a tyrant, and perhaps also against the
recurrence of such a contest for the chief power as had arisen
between Cleisthenes and Isagoras. The public assembly could,
without naming any person, order that on a fixed date a vote
should be taken in which each citizen might write on a potsherd
the name of any man who ought in his opinion to be banished.
In case the name of any citizen was found to be written on six
thousand of the potsherds, he went into exile for a term of years
but did not suffer any further hurt<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>.</p>

<p>Local divisions and local governors had existed in Attica
even before the time of Cleisthenes: the divisions were called
naucrariæ and their governors naucrari. We know nothing
about them except that each naucraria contributed two horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>men
to the army and a ship to the navy, and that the naucrari
assessed the taxation needed for these purposes and had something
to do in the expenditure of it. Cleisthenes established
his demes as local divisions in lieu of the naucrariæ, in each
deme he set up a demarchus or president of the deme, and the
demarchi took over the functions which the naucrari had
hitherto discharged<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>. Beyond what I have stated we know
nothing from direct testimony about the demes in the days of
Cleisthenes: but there can be no doubt that even in his time
the inhabitants of every deme used to meet in assembly and
the assembly regulated the affairs of the deme. There had been
a time when Attica was the home not of one state but of many
independent commonwealths each having its own government<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a>
and its own divinities: and the people in the days of Cleisthenes
had not forgotten the fact, for their descendants eighty years
later in the time of Pericles still cherished its memory<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>. Moreover
the Athenians even so late as the time of Pericles delighted
in country life for its own enjoyments<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>, and even then a majority
of the citizens of Athens lived not in the city but in the
country<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>: and if the attractions of life in the city did not draw
men to desert their demes and live in Athens in the time of
Pericles it is certain that nothing that the city could offer in
the time of Cleisthenes would entice them from rural to urban
life. From all these considerations it is clear that the rural
demes in the days of Cleisthenes were well filled with a resident
population: the resident inhabitants of the rural demes were
citizens of Athens, and, as citizens, took part in settling great
matters of state: and it cannot be supposed that they did not take
part in regulating the comparatively trivial affairs of their own
localities. In the time of Demosthenes about a century and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
half after Cleisthenes the assemblies of the demes were fully
organised bodies and had plenty of business to employ them<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>.</p>

<p>One more change made by Cleisthenes is worth a passing
notice. He ordered the archons to be directly elected, and
abolished all drawing of lots in their appointment. Twenty
years later, in 487 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, the Athenians made the appointment
more a matter of chance than it had ever been: they selected
five hundred, and out of this large number the nine archons
were taken by drawing lots<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>.</p>

<p>I may now give a brief summary of the political condition of
Attica in the days of Cleisthenes. In Attica at that time, as in
all parts of ancient Greece at all times, the population consisted
partly of free men (i.e. the citizens) and their families, and
partly of slaves. In matters of government the decision of
great matters rested with the assembly of all the free men: but,
as most of the free men lived habitually in the country and the
assembly met only about once in a month, the management of
current business was left to the Archons for the year and the
permanent council of the Areopagus composed of Archons and
ex-Archons. The government therefore was a mixture of
different elements: for dealing with ordinary matters the
governors were a small number of the ablest men, while for
dealing with matters of special importance the rulers were the
whole body of free men. In such a government there was no
likelihood that either the rich citizens could oppress the poor
or the poor could oppress the rich: it was in short what
Aristotle afterwards called a Polity, or the rule of all the citizens
conducted for the good of the whole community. There is every
reason to believe that no government with precisely the same
qualities existed elsewhere in Greece: for, if there had been
one, Aristotle, who admired such governments beyond all others,
would have mentioned it in his Politics.</p>

<h4>2. <i>The changes between</i> 480 <span class="small">B.C.</span> <i>and</i> 432 <span class="small">B.C.</span></h4>

<p>The invasion of Greece by the Persians under Xerxes and
the subsequent maritime supremacy of Athens produced great
changes in the character of the Athenian government. When
the Persians had passed over the mountains near Thermopylæ,
Attica lay at their mercy, and the ten generals proclaimed that
every Athenian must save himself as best he could. The council
of the Areopagus however contrived to provide a sum of money
as an instalment of pay for men who were willing to serve on
shipboard; a hundred and eighty ships were manned, and the
men who served, probably about thirty-six thousand in number,
received a sum of eight drachmas apiece. The Athenian fleet,
which was thus provided, formed more than half of the whole
Greek force that won the marvellous battle of Salamis: and
the Areopagus was allowed by the Athenians in recognition of
the service it had rendered to have the chief influence in the
government of Athens for twenty years<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a>. But the whole body
of the citizens who risked their lives in winning the great
battle had contributed more effectually to the result than the
council that found the money. Moreover within a few years
after the defeat of Xerxes the Greek cities in the islands of
the Ægean sea requested Athens to be their defender against
Persian attack: from being protector of the islands Athens soon
became their suzerain, receiving from them contingents of ships
or payments of tribute, and possessing a maritime supremacy
and abundant revenue such as no Greek city had ever enjoyed:
and all these brilliant achievements were due to the exertions
of the poorer citizens who served as common sailors on board
the galleys<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>. Athens, Piræus and Phalerum were fortified and
joined together by the building of the long walls and were
formed into a single city capable of containing a very large
population. The result of these events was a rapid progress
towards democracy: the council of the Areopagus was deprived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
in 462 <span class="small">B.C.</span> of most of its powers<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>, the rules which had hitherto
excluded citizens of the poorer classes from holding the archonship
were repealed or disregarded<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a>, pay was provided for the
citizens whilst serving as judges or jurymen in the law courts<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a>,
and in various ways, twenty thousand&mdash;probably a majority&mdash;of
the citizens were in the employ of the state and received from
it salaries or wages sufficient to maintain them<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a>.</p>


<h4>3. <i>Democracy during the Peloponnesian War</i> 432 <span class="small">B.C.</span>-404 <span class="small">B.C.</span></h4>

<p>The changes which have been mentioned, together with
others which have been passed over, produced the constitution
under which the Athenians lived during their contest with
Sparta. In the description of it we must notice (1) the general
assembly and the council of five hundred, (2) the executive
officers, (3) the judicature, (4) instances illustrative of the
working of the constitution.</p>

<p>(1) The <span lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</span> or general assembly had supreme power
in all the most important matters: it consisted of all Athenian
citizens who had attained the age of manhood: its meetings
were held on the Pnyx, a hillside in the open air: four ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
meetings were held on fixed days in each prytany, and other
meetings for special business could at any time be summoned
by proclamation<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>. Though the assembly had supreme power
to make laws and pass resolutions determining the policy of the
city, it submitted to certain restraining formalities. No law
could be proposed in the assembly till it had been considered
and sanctioned by the council of five hundred<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>: and any resolution
or any new law passed by the assembly might afterwards
be indicted before a popular law-court on the ground that it
violated or contradicted some existing law or was contrary to
the Athenian constitution. If the law or resolution was condemned
by the law-court it was <i lang="la">ipso facto</i> cancelled. Moreover,
if proceedings were taken within a year after the vote of the
assembly, the proposer as well as the proposition might be
indicted, and if the court decided against him he was subject to
a heavy fine. The Greek name for the indictment was Graphê
Paranomôn which may be translated literally Indictment for
Illegality<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>. The Graphê Paranomôn was, beyond all doubt, the
best bulwark of the Athenian constitution: though there were
occasions, as we shall see, when it did not save the constitution
from being violated.</p>

<p>The council consisted of five hundred citizens taken by lot.
It was a committee to manage the details of the business of the
assembly. It met on every day in the year except the religious
festivals or holidays and it drew up the list of business for the
assembly, determining what business ought and what ought not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
to be brought forward. All business intended for the assembly
passed through the hands of the council; and sometimes, in
cases that demanded immediate action, (as in the accusation
brought against the commanders at Arginusæ which will be
described further on,) it had to come to important provisional
decisions. The fifty councillors belonging to a tribe were
presidents during a tenth part of the year: and if, during their
presidency, a special meeting of the assembly was required, it
was their business to summon it<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>.</p>

<p>(2) The chief servants of the sovereign assembly were the
ten generals and the nine archons. The generals were elected
and not like the rest of the officers of the state taken by lot:
this might be inferred from the constant occurrence among the
generals of the names of distinguished men, but it is completely
proved by the fact that in the year 430 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the Athenians
though they were many of them angry with Pericles yet
re-elected him general because his services could not be
dispensed with<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a>. The ten generals levied troops, managed
the revenue allotted to military purposes, and named trierarchs
to command the ships<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a>. In the battle of Marathon and in an
expedition to Samos in 440 <span class="small">B.C.</span> all ten generals acted as
commanders: in most cases the assembly appointed a convenient
number, usually three, of the generals to conduct an
enterprise abroad, while the rest remained at home to manage
the ordinary business of their office.</p>

<p>The nine archons, taken yearly by lot from among a number
of men who had declared themselves to be candidates, and had
submitted the respectability of their characters to a public
examination, had duties of a ceremonial character and attended
to the routine of some business of state, but had no political
influence<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>. There were also some other functionaries for the
supervision of markets and of the supply of corn, and for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
preservation of order, of whom it is not necessary to speak
further.</p>

<p>(3) The judicial bodies alone at Athens were independent
of the political assembly. Jurisdiction, except in those few cases
which were still brought before the semi-religious court of the
Areopagus or before the first Archon, belonged to the popular
law-courts which had been first founded by Solon. A large
number of citizens were taken every year to serve as jurymen:
they were divided into bodies varying in number from two
hundred to a thousand<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a>, and each of these bodies sat collectively
as judges to decide such cases as might be submitted to them.
They sat without any professional judge to inform them about
the condition of the law or the relevance of arguments: the
advocate on either side cited such laws as favoured his contentions,
and could use any reasoning which he thought likely
to influence the court. The citizens were not only willing but
eager to render their services as dicasts, partly because they
received as daily pay three obols, a sum equal to half a modern
franc, and partly because they enjoyed the business of the court
and the importance which it conferred on them<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a>.</p>

<p>(4) The records of some of the meetings of the assembly of
citizens will serve to illustrate the nature of their business.
Just before the Peloponnesian war the Corcyræans requested
the Athenians to protect them with armed force: the body
to whom the Corcyræan envoys made their request was the
assembly of citizens; on the first day the Athenians heard
the arguments of the Corcyræans and of their enemies the
Corinthians: on the second day they debated what answer they
should give; on the third they resolved to grant what the
Corcyræans desired and thereby made the great war inevitable<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a>.
Again in 415 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the ambassadors from Egeste in Sicily, sent
to ask aid from Athens, were heard in the assembly, and it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
agreed on the same day to send an expedition of sixty ships<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>.
In the case of the Peace of Nicias in 423 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the negotiations
were carried on by the ten generals, but the Treaty became
binding on Athens only when it was ratified by the assembly of
the people<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>.</p>

<p>In 428 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Mitylenê in Lesbos, a city allied to Athens under
compulsion, broke loose from the alliance. This revolt was the
work of the oligarchy, which ruled supreme in Mitylenê. In
the summer of the next year Mitylenê had difficulty in withstanding
the forces of the Athenians, and the rulers of the city
found it desirable to give arms to the common folk. With
arms went power. The common folk preferred to be ruled by
Athens rather than by those among their fellow-citizens who
happened to be wealthy, and declared they would surrender to
Paches the Athenian commander. The surrender was effected,
and the fate of the city was to be settled by the Athenians.
The Athenian citizens were very angry that a city which had
been in compulsory alliance with them had revolted, and, making
no distinction between the oligarchical party who had led the
revolt and the democrats who had restored the city to Athens,
voted that every man in Mitylenê of military age should be put
to death, and all the women and children sold into slavery; and
they despatched a galley bearing their orders to Paches. After
the vote they went home and repented of their cruelty: next
day they met again, and after hearing Cleon on the side of
severity and Diodotus for mercy they rescinded the order of the
day before and despatched a second galley to carry the new
orders. The crew of the first galley made no haste in rowing,
because they disliked the work of conveying a cruel and unjust
sentence: and the second galley arrived with the new orders
before the first had taken any effect<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a>.</p>

<p>Judicial work at Athens belonged to the dicasteries and not
to the general assembly: but the assembly also if it wished to
inflict a punishment on an offender against the state could do
so by a special legislative act which might be called in Latin a
privilegium, and in English an attainder or bill of pains and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
penalties. Miltiades, after he had won the great victory of
Marathon, was entrusted with the command of an expedition of
which he did not disclose the object: he used it wrongfully and
unsuccessfully against the Parians, and on his return Xanthippus
proposed to the assembly that he should be put to death for
having deceived the Athenians. The assembly showed mercy
to him in gratitude for his services at Marathon, and let him
off with a very heavy fine of fifty talents<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>.</p>

<p>In the year 406 <span class="small">B.C.</span> an Athenian fleet under the command
of nine <span lang="grc">στρατηγοί</span> or admirals won a great victory over a
Spartan fleet at Arginusæ: several Athenian ships which had
been disabled in the action were lost in a storm which came on
afterwards, and it was suspected that the admirals had made
no efforts to save them. The Athenians superseded all the
admirals and summoned them to Athens. Six of the number
obeyed the summons. One of them was first accused in
a law-court of peculation and misconduct in his command,
and the court ordered him to be kept in custody, with
a view probably to any further proceedings which the general
assembly might choose to take. The other five appeared
before the council of five hundred, which acted as a sort of
business committee to the assembly, and were committed to
custody.</p>

<p>In a general assembly, held soon afterwards, a citizen who
had himself held a subordinate command in the fleet complained
of the conduct of the admirals and desired that they
should be punished. They were allowed to speak briefly in
their defence; and the assembly did not on that day pass any
resolution except that the council of five hundred should consider
what course the proceedings should take, and report their
opinion at the next meeting. During the interval a festival
occurred at which many citizens appeared ostentatiously in
mourning for relatives who had been drowned in the neglected
vessels. When the assembly met, the desire to punish the
admirals had risen high: the council, bringing in its report,
proposed that, as the accusation and the answers had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
already heard, the assembly should proceed to an immediate
vote whether or not the accused should be put to death.
An objection was raised that the established practice required
that a separate vote should be taken about each accused person:
but it was met with a clamour that the people ought to be
allowed to do what it likes. The objection based on established
practice convinced some of the prytaneis or presiding councillors,
but eventually all of them gave way to the clamour, except
Socrates the philosopher. A formal proposal was then made
by a citizen, who shared the views of Socrates, that a vote
should be taken about each man separately. A division was
taken on this proposal, and at first it was declared to be carried:
but on a second scrutiny the proposal originally made by the
council of five hundred was accepted. A vote was then taken
on the proposal that the commanders should suffer death: the
proposal was carried and the sentence executed on the six men
who were in custody<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>.</p>

<p>The constitution, in the time of the Peloponnesian war, was
arranged, in nearly all respects, according to the principles
which the Greeks regarded as distinctive of ideal or extreme
democracy, and tended to ensure firstly that all citizens should
be equally treated in the distribution of offices, and secondly
that the general assembly should be free to do as it liked. The
exceptions to the prevailing tendency are to be found in the
appointment of the ten generals by election, in the right of the
five hundred to exclude a proposal from discussion, and in the
provision that a resolution or new law might be indicted as
unconstitutional before a law court. But the five hundred were
not men of greater wisdom or experience than the other
Athenians, being merely so many citizens taken at random by
drawing lots: it does not appear from the descriptions which
Thucydides gives of debates in the assembly that the generals
or the five hundred exercised any commanding influence: and
the illegal resolution against the admirals who commanded at
Arginusæ took effect, just as if there had been no such thing as
a regulation that it might be judicially indicted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>But it must be observed that what was an ideal democracy
in the eyes of the Greeks was not an ideal democracy according
to the views of our own time. When we speak of a democracy
we generally mean a system of government in which the whole
adult male population have some sort of control over public
affairs. At Athens, a large part, it may have been half, or three-quarters
or five-sixths, of the adult male population were
slaves; and slaves, having lost their personal freedom, are of
course incapable of political rights. If then we wish in speaking
of the Athenian constitution to use terms in their modern sense
and not in their Greek sense, we must say that the rulers of
Athens were not a democracy but an aristocracy: it is true
that they constituted a far larger part of the population than
most aristocracies, but as compared with the whole they were
but few. And further we may observe that without slavery
there could never have been such a government as that which
ruled Athens. The Athenian citizens gave a large part of their
time to public business and attendance at public festivals: and
they could not have done this unless there had been plenty of
slaves to perform the industrial and menial work that the
community required<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a>.</p>

<p>Although Athens ought, according to the modern use of
terms, to be called rather an aristocracy than a democracy, it
seems to be certain that the men actually and habitually
employed in the daily work of government bore numerically a
larger proportion to the whole population in ancient Athens
than they have done in any other state known to history. The
whole population of Attica may have been a quarter of a
million or it may have been nearly half-a-million: the citizens
numbered about thirty thousand, and it is probable that at
least ten thousand of them were habitually employed in the
business of government: and these ten thousand may have
been a twenty-fifth part and were not less than a fiftieth part
of the whole population. In modern England those who are
habitually employed in governing would include members of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
Parliament, of town councils, of county councils, and of school-boards,
magistrates, judges, and the staff of all Government
offices, except those persons who are mere clerks or servants: I
cannot say how many they would muster, all told: but, judging
from those parts of England that I know best, I should estimate
them at something between a two-hundredth and a five-hundredth
part of the inhabitants of the country.</p>


<h4>4. <i>Democracy after the Peloponnesian War</i>, 404-338 <span class="small">B.C.</span></h4>

<p>In the period which followed the Peloponnesian war the
poorer citizens who predominated in the assembly passed several
votes to promote the pleasure and the pecuniary interests of
their class. Pay was provided for every citizen who attended
a meeting of the assembly or was a spectator at a religious
festival and its dramatic performances. The pay was at first
fixed at a low rate: before 392 <span class="small">B.C.</span> it had been raised to three
obols, the same sum as was paid to a dicast for a day's attendance<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a>.
The pay for the law courts, the assemblies, the festivals
and the council came to nearly two hundred talents yearly<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a>.
The whole revenue of the Athenian state in the fourth century
is not known: but it can scarcely have exceeded eleven or
twelve hundred talents<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a>: and thus it seems that about one-sixth
part of it was spent in providing citizens with religious
spectacles or comfortable employment.</p>

<p>After the three obols had been decreed, a majority more
overwhelming than ever was ensured in the assembly to the
poorer class. The professional orators began to devote their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
skill to the purpose of persuading the ecclesia, and thus
obtained a control over Athenian policy. It was fortunate
for the state that in Demosthenes it found not only an orator
but a patriot and a statesman: and it says much for the good
sense of the assembly that it followed his counsels, unless they
interfered too much with the comfort of the individual citizens.
The assembly governed on the whole with moderation, and no
harsh measures against the property of the rich were ever
passed in it: but it insisted that the poor citizens should have
their three obols for the religious spectacles, even when the
money was wanted for a most necessary war to defend Olynthus
against Macedonia<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a>. The very frequent assemblies of the whole
body of citizens gave the poorer classes a decisive voice in all
questions of policy and legislation: but they also ensured that
all the citizens had some knowledge of what was being proposed,
and gave them the habit of listening to arguments, and of
deciding questions by voting and not by force. During the
period from 404 <span class="small">B.C.</span> to 338 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Athens was never troubled with
conspiracies or seditious violence.</p>

<p>The fall of Athens occurred at the end of the period of
which I have been speaking, and no doubt the defects of the
constitution and the unwillingness of the citizens to make any
sacrifices were contributory causes. But it is not certain that,
even if Athens had been as well governed and patriotic as
ever, it would have been able so to unite the jealous Greek
cities as to ensure their independence against the new and
formidable power of Macedonia.</p>

<p>Our materials for forming an estimate of the nature of
democracy in the Greek cities other than Athens are, as I have
said, very scanty. But it seems clear that most of the democracies
ruled with less moderation and self-control than the
Athenian democracy, and had less stability. Revolutions from
democracy to oligarchy or from oligarchy to democracy recurred
at shorter intervals in many Greek cities than at Athens: and
sometimes, as at Corcyra in 427 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and at Argos in 371 <span class="small">B.C.</span> or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
370 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, an unsuccessful attempt at revolution was punished
with wholesale massacre<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a>. It is to be observed that the Greek
writers, in speaking of democracy, generally seem to regard it
with distrust and even dislike: and this could hardly have been
the case, if all democratic governments had been as well conducted
as the Athenian government. We know that at Athens
the whole mass of the citizens were able at any moment to do
whatever they liked, subject to no restraint except from the
Graphê Paranomôn and from their own characters and inclinations:
and it seems certain that in every Greek city mentioned
by the Greek writers as democratically governed the citizens
were still more free from restraint: for many of the best and
most careful writers were great admirers of artificial restraints
on democracy, and if any city had provided itself with such
restraints the fact would have been recorded. It is clear that
a government which allows the mass of the citizens to do
whatever they choose must be beset with dangers, unless the
citizens have learned habits of self-restraint and mutual forbearance
from a long and gradual political education. The Athenians
had learned such habits, but the other Greeks probably had
not: for the Athenians alone among the Greeks had had the
good fortune to live under the wise constitutions of a Solon and
a Cleisthenes, which, by granting to the mass of the citizens at
first a very small share and afterwards a larger share in the
control of public affairs, provided them with such political
training that eventually they were able with safety to expose
themselves to the perils of complete self-government.</p>


<h4>5. <i>Oligarchy at Athens</i>, 411 <span class="small">B.C.</span> <i>and</i> 404 <span class="small">B.C.</span></h4>

<p>In the year 415 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, the seventeenth year of the Peloponnesian
war, the Athenians despatched a great naval and military
expedition to the distant island of Sicily. The expedition
encountered many difficulties: the Athenians sent strong reinforcements:
but in the year 412 <span class="small">B.C.</span> their fleet suffered a
crushing defeat in the Great Harbour of Syracuse, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
army was afterwards completely destroyed. Athens itself was
without any adequate defence of ships or sailors or soldiers<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a>:
the Athenians did their best to supply the deficiency, but there
was grave reason to fear that their unaided efforts would not avail
to save them, and they greatly desired to get support by making
some new alliance. It was certain that no new allies could be
found among the Greeks<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a>, and they could look for no help
unless it were from the king of Persia<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>.</p>

<p>Alcibiades, the ablest but the most unpatriotic and unscrupulous
of the Athenians of that time, was in 412 <span class="small">B.C.</span> an
exile from his native city under sentence of death<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a>. He had in
415 <span class="small">B.C.</span> been appointed one of the three commanders of the
great expedition to Sicily: but, when it was on the eve of
starting from Attica, he fell under suspicion of having committed
a great crime by wilfully offending one of the gods who
protected Athens and of designing to overthrow the Athenian
constitution<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a>. As however there was no proof of his guilt, legal
proceedings could not be immediately instituted, and he was
allowed to sail as one of the commanders of the fleet: but when
he reached Sicily, he found awaiting him the Salaminia, the
swift galley which carried despatches, and on board of her
some officers sent by the Athenian assembly to summon him
home to stand his trial<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>. These officers had been instructed
not to arrest him but merely to bid him come to Athens for
trial: accordingly he sailed homeward in his own ship, under
escort of the Salaminia. On the way the two ships touched at
a port in southern Italy, and Alcibiades went ashore and
escaped from his custodians: soon afterwards, getting a passage
to the Peloponnesus<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a>, he went to Sparta and advised the
Spartans how they might best defeat the Athenian forces in
Sicily<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>. The charges against him were produced before one of
the popular law courts at Athens: and, as he did not appear,
he was found guilty and condemned to death<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>With the Spartans Alcibiades gained great influence, partly
through his intimacy with a powerful man among their Ephors,
and partly by the sound advice which he gave them as to the
best way to injure Athens. In the year 412 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, at his own
earnest desire, he was sent to act on behalf of Sparta in some
of the cities of Asia Minor which were in alliance with Athens,
and to induce them to change sides in the war<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>. Before long
however the Spartans had reason to suspect that he was betraying
their interests, and sent an order to the commander of
their fleet off the coast of Asia to put him to death<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a>. Alcibiades
was warned, and, fleeing to the court of Tissaphernes, a powerful
satrap of the king of Persia in the south-western part of Asia
Minor, became no less zealous and efficient in opposing the
interests of the Spartans than he had been in promoting them:
and, after winning in some degree the confidence of Tissaphernes,
he induced him to withhold a large part of the money which he
had been in the habit of furnishing for the pay of the sailors in
the Lacedæmonian fleet<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>. Having thus completely destroyed
his credit with the Spartans, he desired nothing so much as to
obtain pardon for his offences from his own countrymen<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a>: for
he hoped that, if once the sentence which had been passed on
him were cancelled, he might return to Athens and recover
some of his former popularity and influence.</p>

<p>Alcibiades knew that the Athenians were in a sore strait,
and were longing for an alliance with the king of Persia: and
in this desire of theirs and his own friendly relations with
Tissaphernes he thought he saw the means of effecting his
return: for, if the Athenians could only be persuaded that he
was able and willing through influence with Tissaphernes to
bring about the desired alliance, they would not only let him
return but would welcome him as a valuable friend in their
distress<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>. He believed however that his restoration could more
easily be brought about if the present quiet and orderly government
of Athens were to come to an end, and the city were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
thrown into the turmoil of a revolution<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a>. The surest way to
cause political disturbance was to try to substitute an oligarchy
for the existing democracy: and this accordingly was what
Alcibiades did, not that he liked oligarchy better than democracy,
but because he thought that any political troubles at
Athens might conduce to his restoration<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a>. He sought for fit
agents to bring about the desired revolution, and found them
among the officers of an Athenian fleet stationed at the island
of Samos near the coast of Asia Minor<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a>.</p>

<p>The part of Alcibiades in the revolution consisted only in
giving it a start by raising false expectations of a Persian
alliance. His agents went to Athens, and there Pisander, who
took the leading part among them, addressing the assembly of
the citizens, urged that the only hope of salvation for Athens
lay in an alliance with Persia, and declared that that alliance
would be made if they would invite Alcibiades to return,
abolish their democracy, which was not to the liking of the
king of Persia, and set up in its stead an oligarchy which the
king could trust<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a>. The assembly was grieved at the prospect
of losing its democratic constitution, but under the stress of
circumstances gave some kind of provisional approval of the
proposed change; for the present however it took no definite
step beyond appointing Pisander and ten other men as envoys to
negotiate with Alcibiades and Tissaphernes. Pisander remained
for a while in Athens for the purpose of visiting all the oligarchical
clubs which already existed there and preparing them to
be ready to strike a blow against the democratic constitution:
this done, he departed on his mission<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a>. It soon became evident
that Alcibiades was powerless to obtain help for Athens from
the king of Persia or even from Tissaphernes: a breach occurred
between him and the oligarchical conspirators, and he took no
further part in their proceedings<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>.</p>

<p>During the absence of Pisander the oligarchical clubs at
Athens prepared the way for the success of his designs by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
skilfully organising a series of assassinations. The persons
selected to be murdered were the most faithful upholders of the
democratic constitution: the assassins were never brought to
justice: and such general terror prevailed that men did not
dare to mourn for the victims lest their own turn should come
next<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a>. Meanwhile the chief politicians in the oligarchic party,
wishing to disguise their real designs, gave out that the changes
in the constitution which they would advocate were moderate
in character: they would limit the number of citizens who
formed the ecclesia to a number not exceeding five thousand,
consisting of those who were best able to aid the state by
paying taxes or by serving in the war, and would propose that
henceforth wages from the treasury should be paid to none but
the soldiers and sailors: but in other respects they would wish
the constitution to remain unaltered<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>.</p>

<p>Pisander, on his return to Athens about April 411 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>, was
eager for the establishment of an oligarchy, with himself as one
of its leading members: and, even if he had wished to pause in
his measures, it was now dangerous for him to do so, because, if
the citizens recovered from their terror, he would be prosecuted
under a Graphê Paranomôn for the proposals which he had
made and carried last year, and would undergo severe punishment.
One of his adherents named Pythodorus at once proposed
to the assembly that it should appoint a small committee
of citizens to make a draft scheme for a new constitution:
Cleitophon, who was probably an opponent of Pisander, moved
that it should be an instruction to the committee that they
should examine the ancient constitution of Cleisthenes to see
whether any of its provisions ought to be revived. The proposal
of Pythodorus was carried: whether Cleitophon's instruction
was accepted or rejected we do not know<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>Within a short time the committee had prepared its proposals.
An assembly of the citizens was summoned to meet, not
as usual at the Pnyx within the city, but at the hill of Colonus,
more than a mile outside the walls. At this assembly the
proposals of the committee were announced; and they were to
the following effect. (1) Any Athenian citizen may propose
whatever he thinks fit; and no proposal shall make him liable
to a Graphê Paranomôn. (2) The government (that is to say,
the right of speaking and voting in the ecclesia) shall be
entrusted, during the continuance of the war, to a body of
citizens numbering not less than Five Thousand, and consisting
of those best qualified by bodily vigour for serving in the
war or by wealth for contributing to the public treasury.
(3) During the continuance of the war no wages shall be paid
from the treasury except to the army and navy, and the nine
archons and the presidents of the assembly and council<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a>.</p>

<p>The proposals bore a specious aspect of moderation, and
seemed to promise that the new constitution should be something
like the old constitution of Cleisthenes. The assembly
gave its assent to these proposals: but, as soon as that assent
had been given, it found that further and more radical changes
awaited it. A motion was made and carried that a second
committee of a hundred citizens should be appointed to give
more precise shape to the new constitution. The report of this
second committee, an elaborate document, disclosed the real
intentions of Pisander and his party. It set forth a complicated
scheme of government which was to come into force at some
future time: but it also did what was more important by
proposing that for the present a council of Four Hundred
should be elected, that the Four Hundred should appoint ten
generals and a secretary to the generals, and that the eleven
men thus appointed should have power to do everything except
alter the laws<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a>. The proposals were ratified by the assembly;
the council of Four Hundred, being elected during the reign of
terror which had been established, was no doubt entirely filled
with the adherents of Pisander, and the ten generals and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
secretary no doubt included Pisander himself and his most
ardent partisans. No steps were taken to call the assembly of
Five Thousand into existence, and thus all political rights had
been taken away from the mass of the citizens, and unrestrained
power was conferred upon Pisander and his fellow-conspirators<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a>.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the oligarchy which had thus been
founded are not narrated in detail by our authorities: but we
are told that the new rulers governed violently, and made many
changes in the administration: that they "put to death some
few men who seemed convenient to be got rid of, imprisoned
others, and removed others from Attica<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a>," that they fell to
quarrelling with one another<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a>, and that at last they were
suspected of a design to introduce a garrison of Spartans into
the Piræus, the port of Athens. As soon as this suspicion
gained credence the days of the oligarchy were numbered. A
battalion of Athenian hoplites, employed by Pisander to build
a fortress at the mouth of the Piræus for the reception of a
Lacedæmonian garrison, rose in mutiny against their officers,
held a meeting in Munychia, which adjoins the Piræus, to
decide on their course of action, and after due deliberation
marched into Athens and piled arms at the foot of the Acropolis.
Many specious offers of ineffectual reforms were made
to them by envoys from the Four Hundred: but they insisted
on the one thing which the oligarchy most dreaded, a free
assembly of the citizens to be held within the city. The
citizens met in assembly at the Pnyx, and their first resolution
declared that the power of the Four Hundred was at an end<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>.</p>

<p>After the deposition of the Four Hundred, which occurred
late in August 411 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, the Athenians had to decide what their
government should be. Two courses lay open to them: they
might rescind all the enactments which they had made four
months earlier, and so return at once to an unmixed democracy:
or they might allow those enactments, except such as were
obviously mischievous, to remain in force. The second of the
two alternatives was that which they adopted. They reaffirmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
in substance the regulations which had been recommended by
the small committee elected under the resolution of Pythodorus,
and enacted: (1) That the government should be entrusted to
the body of not less than Five Thousand, which they had
already ordered to be created. (2) That every citizen, who
furnished the equipment of a heavy armed soldier, either for
himself or for any one else, should of right be a member of this
body. (3) That no citizen should receive pay for any political
function, on pain of being solemnly accursed or excommunicated<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a>.
The constitution thus established was partly democratic
and partly oligarchical: it contained a preponderant element of
democracy because it gave supreme power to a numerous body,
who, though they were called the Five Thousand, were in
reality about nine thousand<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a>: but it also contained some small
oligarchical ingredients, since it excluded the poorest citizens
from the ecclesia, and by withholding payment for the discharge
of political functions made it likely that few citizens would be
able to serve on the council of five hundred and in the popular
law-courts except those who had money and leisure. Concerning
the motives which induced the Athenians to adopt this
mixed form of government we have no information, and can
only observe that the new constitution would certainly commend
itself to the body of hoplites who had delivered the Athenians
from their oppressors, since it gave supreme power to the class
to which they belonged; and that, from what we know of the
political opinions of Socrates<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a>, we may be sure that it met with
his hearty approval and was supported by his powerful advocacy.
In regard to the merits of the new government we have an
emphatic testimony from Thucydides, who says that of all the
governments that ruled Athens within the space of his lifetime
this was the best<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>. But the mixed form of government was
not suited to the needs and the condition of the Athenians: for
within a few years&mdash;certainly before 406 <span class="small">B.C.</span> when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
condemned the commanders at Arginusæ, and possibly as early as
410 <span class="small">B.C.</span>&mdash;they abandoned it and reverted to their well-tried
system of unmixed democracy.</p>

<p>Within seven years after the fall of the Four Hundred,
Athens was again ruled by an oligarchy. The events which
led to the establishment of this second oligarchy were in one
respect like those to which the earlier oligarchy owed its origin,
since they began with the destruction of an Athenian fleet: but,
as they were simpler and less complicated, they can be more
briefly narrated.</p>

<p>In the year 405 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the Athenians sent nearly the whole of
their naval force to oppose the Lacedæmonian fleet in the
eastern waters of the Ægean sea, along the coast of Asia Minor.
In number of ships the Athenian and Lacedæmonian fleets were
nearly equal: in all else they were ill-matched antagonists.
The Lacedæmonians were commanded by Lysander, the ablest
admiral ever produced by Sparta: the condition of the Athenians
was such as might be expected in the year immediately following
an undiscriminating execution of the commanders of the
fleet. Among the six<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> admirals Conon alone was a man of
ability, discipline was lax, and the operations were worse
designed and worse executed than any others in the whole
course of the war. Lysander took the city of Lampsacus on the
eastern shore of the narrow channel of the Hellespont which
divides Europe from Asia. The Athenian commanders took
station directly opposite on the western shore of the Hellespont,
which at this point is only two miles wide, and there anchored
their ships close to the open beach of Ægospotami. The
nearest place from which they could get supplies was Sestos,
two miles distant: and all the commanders except Conon and
the captain of the Paralus, the despatch-boat, allowed their
men to go ashore and wander far inland. Lysander watched
his opportunity, found the ships for the most part deserted by
their crews, and captured the whole of them (a hundred and
eighty in number), except the Paralus and a little squadron of
eight ships under the immediate command of Conon<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p>After the battle of Ægospotami Athens could make no
effectual resistance. Lysander blockaded the city by land and
sea, and in the spring of 404 <span class="small">B.C.</span> the Athenians were compelled
by starvation to capitulate and admit the Spartans. Lysander
occupied the city, compelled the Athenians to pull down at
least a great part of the long walls which defended Athens and
Piræus, to readmit the members of the oligarchical party who
had gone into exile, and to submit to be governed by them<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a>.
Arbitrary power was assumed by a Board of Thirty, who, being
supported by Lysander, were able for eight months to oppress
their fellow citizens with violence and rapacity such as had not
been experienced in Athens even under the Four Hundred<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a>.</p>

<p>The governments both of the Four Hundred and of the
Thirty were too short-lived to furnish us with materials for
forming any precise estimate of Greek oligarchy in general.
They never went beyond the stage of being revolutionary or
half-established governments: and, being in constant terror of
destruction, they were obliged to resort to cruel measures which
a settled oligarchy would not need. The mere fact that Greek
oligarchies were often long-lived governments suffices to show
that they were not, like the rule of the Four Hundred or the
Thirty, so sanguinary and oppressive as to provoke successful
mutiny or rebellion: and we are entitled to believe that, as
Athenian democracy was the best of Greek democracies, so
Athenian oligarchy was the worst of Greek oligarchies.</p>


<h3>IV. <i>The conquest of the Greek cities by Macedonia.</i></h3>

<p>The division of the Greek people into a large number of
small independent cities was a system which answered well
enough as long as the political horizon included no states
other than Greek cities and Asiatic Empires. The Macedonians
were a European people inhabiting a large territory to the
north of Greece, and united under a strong military monarchy.
They had formerly lived under a tribal monarchy of the heroic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
type: in the fourth century <span class="small">B.C.</span> they may be compared with the
Goths under Alaric or the Salian Franks under Clovis. They
were devoted to military pursuits: they had some of the spirit
of individual independence which is usually found in a rude
people of warriors, and they showed it even under Alexander
the Great, the strongest of all their kings<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>: but their king was
their commander, and in time of war, so long as he commanded
ably, he enjoyed supreme power. To resist such a people as the
Macedonians the Greeks would have had to do the impossible:
to unlearn in a moment all the maxims of jealous precaution
against rival cities by which they had regulated their conduct,
to give up the practice of politics in miniature and understand
at once what was needed in politics on a larger scale. As it
was, the old jealousy between Athens and Sparta continued to
be as active as ever, only one or two Greek states joined in
resistance to the invader, and after the battle of Chæroneia
in 338 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Greece lay at the mercy of Philip king of Macedonia.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="ph">ARISTOTLE'S CLASSIFICATION OF POLITIES.</p>


<p>I have now described, in a roughly chronological order, the
different kinds of government which successively appeared in
the Greek states from their infancy to their overthrow by
Macedonia. I proceed to give clearer ideas both of the
principles on which those governments were constructed and
of the full meaning of certain terms employed in the foregoing
descriptions of them, by stating the classification of polities
which Aristotle gives us in his treatise on Politics. The time
at which this work was written cannot be precisely determined,
but part of it was certainly composed after, and other parts
probably before, the battle of Chæroneia<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a>.</p>

<p>Aristotle observed all the governments that he knew, and as
the result of his observation divided polities (that is to say,
forms of government, or principles on which governments were
constructed or might be constructed) into two classes, the right
or normal polities in which government was carried on for the
good of the whole community, and the perverted or abnormal
polities in which it was conducted by the governors for their
own private interest. Further, since he observed that in all
the polities power was lodged in the hands either of one person,
or of a few, or of the citizens in general, he subdivided each
of his two classes into three species according as power belonged
to one person, or to few, or to many. Among the normal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
polities the first species was characterized by the rule of
one man for the good of all, and was known as <span lang="grc">βασιλεία</span> or
kingship: in the second the few best men ruled for the good of
all, and it was known as <span lang="grc">ἀριστοκρατία</span> or the rule of the best:
the third, where a large number of citizens ruled for the good
of all, deserved in a special and honourable sense the name of
<span lang="grc">πολιτεία</span>(Polity, or the rule of <span lang="grc">πολῖται</span>&mdash;a Commonwealth),
which was more loosely applied to all constitutions. Among
the perverted polities the first species was tyranny, or the rule
of one man for his private interest; the second oligarchy, or the
selfish rule of the few (who in practice were always identical
with the rich); and the third democracy, the rule of the many
(or rather of the poor, since the poor are always the most
numerous) for the selfish interest of their class<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a>.</p>

<p>The character of the several species of polity is better
understood from the observation of concrete instances than from
mere definition.</p>

<p>(1) Kingship, the rule of one for the good of all, is best
exemplified in the monarchies of the heroic age of Greece, in
which the kings ruled over willing subjects, came to the throne by
inheritance and not by violence, and governed within the limits
imposed by custom<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a>. Other instances of kingship occurred in
the early history of Lacedæmonia, in Macedonia, and among the
Molossians: for in all these cases the kings owed their power to
the gratitude of their subjects for good services which they had
rendered in founding the state or in acquiring new territory<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a>.
Even the Persian monarchy of Cyrus and Darius, although
despotic, was an example of kingship and belonged to the normal
polities: for the power of the king was controlled by custom and
acquired not by violence but by inheritance, and its despotic
nature was merely an accident due to the slavish character of
the Asiatics<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a>. Beside the heroic monarchies of the Greeks we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
may set the governments of such kings as Cerdic of Wessex,
Ethelbert of Kent, Edwin of Northumbria, and Alfred the
Great: with the conquering kings of Macedonia we may
compare Alaric the Visigoth or Clovis the Frank: and for the
monarchy of the Persians we may find a parallel in the
Ottoman sultanate of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>(2) Aristocracy is constituted on the principle that power
belongs to those few best men who are best qualified to use
it for the good of the community<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a>. The principle that power is
based upon merit belongs to the best kind of monarchy, as we
have just seen, and the only difference between aristocracy
and this best kingship is that aristocracy gives the power to
more than one and kingship to one only.</p>

<p>There is no instance in Greek history of an aristocracy
pure and simple. The most aristocratic governments in Greece
were those of the tribes in the heroic age and the government
of Sparta before 500 <span class="small">B.C.</span>: but all these were instances of
aristocracy combined with kingship. The elders who formed
the Spartan council were selected for merit and the councils
were aristocratic: but the kingly power was important as well
as the power of the council, and the Spartan government is to
be classed as a monarchy with a large element of aristocracy.</p>

<p>The principle that power and merit should go together was
very sparingly applied in the other Greek states, and the usual
method of appointing to offices was by drawing lots among the
candidates: exceptional instances of the use of voting in
elections are found at Athens in the cases of the archons for
a few years after 508 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a>, and of the ten generals throughout
the period of the democracy.</p>

<p>The constitution of Rome in the third century <span class="small">B.C.</span> and
especially after the battle of Cannæ, when magistrates were
selected for merit without regard to their patrician or plebeian
order, and the senate, the supreme power in the government,
was filled entirely with men who had served as magistrates or
been named senators for high character and ability, is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
example of almost unmixed aristocracy. The small non-aristocratic
elements in that constitution were democratic or
oligarchic.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that it is according to Aristotle an
aristocratic feature in a government if officers are appointed by
election and not by lot, because if officers are elected power and
merit tend to go together<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a>. Hence it may be regarded as an
aristocratic feature in modern states that members of Parliament
are elected, provided they are elected for merit: if they
are elected for their willingness to give pledges, they are no
longer elected for merit, and they will use their power not for
the good of all but to comply with the wishes of their constituents,
and the real rulers will be the constituents.</p>

<p>The appointment of the Premier and the Cabinet must be
made according to merit and is aristocratic. The English
method of selecting officers for the army and for the civil
service by competitive examination is in principle aristocratic,
being adopted because merit is shown by success in examination.</p>

<p>(3) Of Polity, the rule of many for the good of all, there
are many species. Aristotle describes some of them in general
terms, but does not name a definite example of any.</p>

<p>The first species was a form of government adopted by
some Greek peoples after the fall of the heroic monarchies. In
that age distinctions of class depended on military efficiency,
and military efficiency on wealth. The only effective warriors
were those who fought on horseback or from a chariot (we do
not know whether chariots were still used in fighting, and Aristotle's
words are ambiguous): those men who possessed horses,
whether they served in war themselves or placed their horses
at the disposal of other warriors, helped to furnish the effective
part of the army; and, because they rendered this service to
the community, they became the ruling class. In the Polity
thus constituted the ruling class was not a large one, though
larger than the ruling class in a mere oligarchy: and this
species of Polity, though it was not oligarchy, had a somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
oligarchical character. The second species of Polity was
constructed on much the same lines as the first, but in a later
age, when the effective warriors included not only the horsemen
but also a much larger force of heavy armed infantry or
hoplites. In this case, as in the other, military efficiency was
dependent on property: the panoply, or complete suit of
armour and set of weapons which a hoplite required, had to
be skilfully wrought, and was a possession beyond the means
of the poor, though it cost far less than the breeding and keep
of a horse. The ruling class included every man who furnished,
either for his own use or for use by another, either a war-horse
or the equipment of a hoplite: and the ruling class was so large
that the Polities of the second species were known in the times
when they existed, though not in Aristotle's time, as democracies<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a>.
There were also many other varieties of Polities. In
all of them, political power was shared by a class or classes
which included a large part of the free men, and therefore the
classes that were neither very rich nor very poor were of great
political importance. The importance of the upper and middle
classes might be secured by various methods: by conceding
political rights only to those who had a certain amount of
property, the amount being so fixed that those who had
political rights were slightly more numerous than those who
had them not; by giving political rights to all free men but
compelling those who had property to be regular, under pain
of a fine, in attendance at the assembly; or by other like
devices.</p>

<p>The one feature common to all Polities was that they were
made by a fusion of oligarchy and democracy. They were in
one way democratic because they conceded political rights to a
large body of free men: but in another sense they had a trace
of oligarchy in their composition, because they gave more power
to a man with property than to one who was very poor<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a>.</p>

<p>From what has been said it is clear that the second species<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
of Polity is well exemplified in the system of government which
existed in most of the German tribes in the time of Cæsar
or Tacitus: a system in which the assembly of the warriors,
including both horsemen and foot soldiers, determined the
action of the community. The name Polity may also be
applied to the government established at Athens by Solon, in
which the power granted to the common people was only just
so much as to prevent them from being disaffected<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a>: and to
the constitution of Cleisthenes, in which the assembly of the
citizens was supreme, but did not hold its meetings very
frequently, and showed no undue favour toward the poorer
citizens. And, finally, all modern governments with popular
representative institutions, though they differ from Aristotle's
Polity in many important features, yet have more in common
with that kind of government than with any other that
Aristotle recognises.</p>

<p>(4) We turn to the three perverted forms of government.
Democracy, the rule of the many (or rather of the poor, since
the poor are always the most numerous) for the selfish interest
of their own class, will be considered first, because it is the
least strongly contrasted with the right polities which have
been already examined. The word democracy, as has been
noticed above, did not always denote an extreme democracy, for
there was a time when it was applied to those moderate
governments which Aristotle calls Polities: and Aristotle
himself is not perfectly constant in his use of the word, since
there is a passage<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> in which he makes it comprehend both
moderate and extreme popular rule. The democracy however
which we now have to consider is the extreme or thoroughgoing
democracy.</p>

<p>From many passages in the Politics we learn what Aristotle
regarded as the distinctive features and tendencies of complete
democracy.</p>

<p>Democracy was a form of government which arose in cities
with a large population and a large revenue: the whole of the
citizens not only were theoretically admitted to a share in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
work of governing, but actively and habitually exercised their
powers, and those citizens who could not otherwise afford the
time to attend assemblies were enabled to do so by receiving
remuneration out of the state treasury. And indeed such a
population had more leisure than any other for attendance
at the assemblies and for serving on juries: for, as their private
property was small, their time was not used up in attending
to the management of it. The consequence was that under
this form of government the ultimate authority in the state
was not any established constitution but the mass of the poor
citizens<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a>.</p>

<p>Again in another striking passage Aristotle says that there
are democracies in which the ultimate authority is not the
established constitution but the mass of the people and the
resolutions which the people chooses to make.... In these
democracies the common folk becomes a monarch, a monarch
composed of many men, a multitude reigning collectively.... The
common folk, being a monarch, determines to rule as a monarch
owing no obedience to the constitution, so that, becoming a
despot, it esteems most highly those men who flatter it the
most: and this kind of democracy holds the same place among
popular governments as tyranny among kingly governments.
The same temper and character is found in this democracy
as in tyranny: both of them are arbitrary rulers of the better
citizens, only the one rules by resolutions, the other by decrees,
and the one is influenced by demagogues, the other by
personal adulators<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a>.</p>

<p>In yet other passages we are told that democratically
governed cities are beyond all others anxious to ensure equality
among their citizens, and that the use of ostracism for the
expulsion of any man, who from wealth or personal popularity
or from any other cause has unusual political influence, is a
result of this anxiety<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a>: and when we find that the practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
of appointing to offices by drawing lots is democratic<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a>, we may
observe (though Aristotle does not say so) that this also is
a striking exemplification of the same guiding principle.
When we read that the principle of democracy is freedom<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> we
must, considering the tenor of two passages which have been
already quoted, understand that the freedom that is meant
is not the freedom of the individual but the freedom of the
assembly to do whatever it pleases.</p>

<p>The marks then of a pure democracy as conceived by
Aristotle are these: (1) All the citizens, and more especially
the poor citizens, actively and habitually control the business of
government, and come together in frequent general assemblies
for that purpose: (2) The assembly of citizens is free to do
whatever it pleases, not being bound to conform to any law,
precedent, or established constitution: (3) Every citizen has,
as far as the nature of things permits, an equal share with
every other citizen of political power and the enjoyment of office.</p>

<p>It is certain that Aristotle regarded the Athenian constitution
as an example of the genuine or extreme species of democracy,
since that constitution cannot be brought under any of the
other species which he defines: moreover he says explicitly that
it is only in the extreme form of democracy that demagogues
are to be found<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a>, and we know from history that demagogues
were plentiful and powerful at Athens. But much of what he
says about extreme democracy cannot be taken as referring to
Athenian democracy: at any rate it does not accurately depict
the democracy under which the Athenians lived. In support
of these statements, I may adduce two facts. Firstly, the
Athenian assembly was not in practice free to do whatever it
liked, and was not above the law and the constitution. It
could indeed decide in favour of an unconstitutional measure
whenever it chose, and its decision was carried into effect: but
the proposer of the measure acted at his peril. In case the
people after accepting his proposal continued for a whole year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
to think it good and useful, he was safe: but if within the year
his measure became unpopular, he was certain to be condemned
under a Graphê Paranomôn, and to suffer heavy penalties.
And secondly, the passage, in which Aristotle denounces
extreme democracy for turning the common folk into an
arbitrary ruler who defies law and precedent and oppresses the
wealthier citizens, can only refer to cases in which the poorer
classes take pleasure in reckless changes and in robbery of the
rich: at Athens the assembly, though the poor citizens predominated
in it, disliked changes and was considerate towards
the wealthy citizens<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a>.</p>

<p>The mischiefs which Aristotle regarded as attendant on
democracies have certainly been found in some governments
which have borne that name. Aristotle could not have
denounced them as he does unless he had seen them exemplified
in some Greek democracies: in the governments
(nominally at least democratic), which ruled in Paris during
the French Revolution, all and more than all the evils that
he describes were to be found. Athens was practically exempt
from them, and we may seek causes for its immunity. One
cause, the long training that the Athenians went through
under the constitution of Cleisthenes, has been already noticed:
the other was that at Athens the principles on which Greek
democracy was founded were actually followed out in the daily
life of the community, the citizens gave their time and attention
to the work of government, and the people was far more
truly a self-governing people than any other that has ever
existed.</p>

<p>From what has just been said it will be seen that I regard
Athens as the sole historical example of a true democracy in
the Greek sense of the term. The Florentine Republic after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
1324 <span class="small">A.D.</span> is often compared with the Athenian democracy:
but, out of the three characteristics of Greek democracy, the
Florentine constitution had only the two least important: the
citizens had indeed, as far as possible, equal shares in the
enjoyment of office, and the assembly was free to do as it liked:
but the assembly was rarely convoked, and the true governors
were not the assembled citizens, but some fifty citizens selected
by drawing lots every two months or every four months to fill
the various magistracies and boards which ruled the city<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a>.
In modern Switzerland some faint traces of actual self-government
by the citizens can be detected in the yearly
assemblies held in four of the smaller cantons, and in the
cantonal and federal Referenda, or popular votes on new laws:
but they are no more than traces, and do not make the Swiss
government at all like the Athenian: and, beside this,
Switzerland is a federal state while Athens was a city, and for
that reason the two states are so unlike that it is useless to
compare them.</p>

<p>(5) Oligarchy, or the rule of the few rich for the advantage
of their own class, admits of several degrees and varieties.
There is something of oligarchy wherever the enjoyment
of public office is limited to those who have a certain amount
of property: there is a larger element of oligarchy if the qualifying
amount is fixed extremely high, or if the body of rulers
fill up vacancies in their own number, or if offices descend from
father to son: and the state is completely oligarchic if, besides
all this, the law does not control the rulers but the rulers
control the law<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a>. We may detect a minute trace of oligarchy
in Solon's constitution which excluded the poorest citizens from
the archonship. Perfect oligarchies are exemplified in the
Bacchiadæ of Corinth whose power was hereditary and set
them above the law, so that they could order Labda's child
to be killed, and in the Eupatridæ or hereditary nobles of
Athens, whose oppressive rule necessitated Solon's reforms.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
Other instances of oligarchy are found in the exclusive rule
of the patricians at Rome from 510 <span class="small">B.C.</span> to 367 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and in
the monopoly of office which was enjoyed by the wealthiest
class of the Romans between 150 <span class="small">B.C.</span> and the time of Julius
Cæsar. The most complete example of an oligarchy is found
at Venice between 1310 and the fall of the republic in 1797.</p>

<p>(6) Tyranny, the rule of one man for his private interest,
has been exemplified in the stories of the despots of Corinth
and Athens. For other instances we must go to the great
storehouse of illustrations of tyranny, the mediæval history of
Italy where, besides the well known despots Eccelin da Romano,
the Visconti, the Medici, and Cesar Borgia, there is such a host
of minor tyrants that pages might be filled with a mere enumeration
of their names.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to make some general remarks on
Aristotle's classification of polities&mdash;to see in some measure
what it was, and what it was not.</p>

<p>Aristotle defined a polity as "an ordering or arrangement of
a state in respect of its offices generally and especially of the
supreme office<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a>": and from this definition, as well as from his
use of the word <span lang="grc">πολιτεία</span>, it is clear that he regarded a polity
as the form on which a whole government and not merely a
part of a government was constructed. But nevertheless he
recognised that a government consisting wholly of kingship or
wholly of aristocracy was, at least among the Greeks, merely an
ideal or perhaps an imaginary government, and was not within
the range of practical politics<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a>. And herein Greek history
shows that he was right: for we never find in it a whole
government composed solely of kingship or wholly of aristocracy.
On the other hand we find that not only kingship
and aristocracy, but also oligarchy and democracy, constantly
occur as forms or principles on which a part of a government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
was constructed: for example the ancient Spartan constitution
was in one part kingly, in another aristocratic, in another democratic;
Solon's constitution contained elements both of democracy
and of oligarchy; and even the mature Athenian democracy
contained a trace of aristocracy in the selection of the ten
generals for merit and not by chance. Hence it is clear that,
while kingship, aristocracy, polity, democracy, oligarchy and
tyranny were polities, and each of them was a form on which a
whole government either real or ideal could be erected, four
of them at least, kingship, aristocracy, democracy and oligarchy,
were also forms on which a part of a government could be
constructed, and which entered in very various combinations
into the making of actual governments.</p>

<p>From what has been said it will be seen that Aristotle's
classification of polities was based much more on philosophic
theory than on history and that, in some part at least of its
extent, it is not a direct classification of actual and concrete
governments.</p>

<p>The only actual governments which it directly and straightforwardly
classifies are those which were constructed wholly on
the lines of any single one of the six polities, and these were
tyrannies, pure oligarchies and Polities. As to the rest of the
governments which Aristotle knew, it enabled him to describe
them admirably, but did not help him to assign to them brief,
distinctive and convenient class-names: for instance, it enabled
him to describe the Spartan government as containing elements
of kingship, of aristocracy and of democracy, and the constitution
of the Phœnician city of Carthage as containing elements of
kingship, aristocracy, oligarchy and democracy; but it did not
furnish him with any class-name for either of those governments
other than the single word normal or the descriptions
of them which have just been mentioned<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a>.</p>

<p>It has been necessary for me in speaking of the Greek
governments to employ some class-names, and the names that
I have used are tribal governments and city governments.
The mere fact of using these names implied an assumption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
that the governments of the Greek tribes and the governments
of the Greek cities formed in some way two distinct classes.
With the aid of the Aristotelian polities and our historical
examination of Greek governments we may now make some
observations which will help us to see whether the assumption
was justified by facts.</p>

<p>Firstly, it may be noticed that all governments of Greek
tribes were mixed governments containing within them in
combination both the rule of the one and the rule of the
few, or both the rule of the few and the rule of the many:
and all governments of Greek city states were pure or unmixed
governments, that is to say pure oligarchy, or pure tyranny, or
pure democracy (in so far as a pure democracy is in the nature of
things possible). In making this general statement about the
governments of city states I do not regard Argolis from the
time of Pheidon to 480 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and Athens in the days of Cleisthenes
as city states in the strictest sense of the term: for in
Argolis the central city of Argos was by no means the sole place
of importance, but was counterbalanced by the two ancient
cities of Tiryns and Mycenæ, and in Attica in the time of
Cleisthenes the rural districts were in some respects as important
as the city of Athens.</p>

<p>Secondly, all the governments of the tribes were limited
and constitutional, and all the governments of the city states
with one possible exception, were absolute or unconstitutional.
These propositions might almost be regarded as corollaries
to those which preceded them, since in a mixed government
the various elements impose limitations on the authority of
one another, and ensure that each of them shall be subject
to a constitution or general understanding about the exercise
of power, while in an unmixed government the ruling person
or class is likely to be subject to no restrictions: but it is more
satisfactory to establish their truth from history. A moment's
consideration shows that the mixed governments which prevailed
in the tribes of the heroic age and at ancient Sparta, as well as
those in which the military class were the ruling class, were all
limited and constitutional. The unmixed governments of the
cities were oligarchies, or tyrannies, or democracies. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
obvious that oligarchies and tyrannies were absolute governments,
and in a democracy Aristotle tells us that the ruling
class, the whole body of citizens, was above the law. The one
possible exception occurs in the fully developed Athenian
democracy, which was in many respects exceptional among
Greek democracies. It is by no means clear that at Athens the
mass of the citizens was an absolute ruler. The truth seems to
be that it was an absolute ruler in so far that there were
no limitations that it could not throw off at pleasure, but
in practice it was very much like a constitutional ruler because it
voluntarily submitted to formalities which restrained its actions.</p>

<p>Thirdly, in the tribes, government was conducted for the
good of the whole community; in the city states, except
perhaps Athens, it was conducted for the good of the rulers.
After all that has been said, these propositions require no
further proving.</p>

<p>We find then that in the tribes governments were mixed,
constitutional and, in Aristotle's sense, normal; in the city
states they were unmixed, and with one possible exception they
were absolute and, in Aristotle's sense, abnormal or perverted.</p>

<p>Now that we have discovered from observation of numerous
instances that the governments of the Greek tribes and the
governments of the Greek cities stood in strong contrast with
one another, we may try to find out the causes to which the
contrast was due.</p>

<p>In the case of tribes it is impossible to make out completely
why their governments were mixed, constitutional, and normal,
because we know but little about the tribes and nothing of
their history. But at any rate we may observe that the tribes
were militant communities engaged in a constant struggle for
existence with other similar communities, and that in such
communities it is essential to the safety of each and all of their
members that all the classes which contribute to the fighting
strength should be kept contented and zealous in the common
cause, and that therefore it is necessary that none of those
classes should be oppressed and that each should have its fair
share in determining their common action.</p>

<p>In the case of city states the reasons why the governments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
were unmixed, absolute, and abnormal are best seen
contrasting a city state with a larger political community:
for example, England in the middle ages. In that large political
community it was impossible, owing to the size of the territory,
the importance of the country districts, and the diverse characters
of different districts, for any single person or class to engross
all power and become the sole ruler. The size of the territory
necessitated the existence of local rulers or magnates, the
barons: and diversities of local character made each locality
inclined in case of need to act for itself under its own baron.
The result was that if any person or class attempted to become
omnipotent and oppressive, some of the local districts rose
in revolt under their barons and the attempt ended in failure.
In a city state all the circumstances were different: the country
districts had no strength or importance, the power, whether it
was a person or a class, that ruled in the city, met with
no resistance from outside the city, and, owing to the small
size of the territory, had all its enemies within its reach,
and could easily destroy them unless they chose to go into
exile.</p>

<p>In my second chapter it was stated tentatively and without
proof that there is an intimate connexion between the form of a
political body and the form of the government by which it
is ruled. The connexion between form of political body and
form of government has now been traced in the case of the
Greek tribes and cities, and it has been shown that the assumption
which I made when I divided the Greek governments
before the battle of Chæroneia into tribal governments and
city governments was one for which history affords justification.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="ph">THE ACHÆAN LEAGUE<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a>.</p>


<p>The Achæan peoples of the heroic age, when they were
driven by the invading Dorians from Sparta, Messenia, Argos
and Corinth, took refuge in the northern part of the Peloponnesus
and there founded the Achæan people of the historical
period. The district in which they settled measures only about
sixty-five English miles from east to west along the coast of the
Corinthian gulf, and from twelve to twenty miles from north to
south. It is cut off from the rest of the Peloponnesus by a
range of lofty mountains which cannot in any part be crossed
without difficulty. From this mountain range many ridges run
northward, dividing the country into narrow valleys<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a>. The
past history of the Achæans and the character of their territory
made them well suited for a federal form of government; that
is to say, for having a single government for some purposes and
many governments for other purposes. They were impelled
towards union by their common Achæan race, by common
experience of conquest by the Dorians, and by the certainty
that, if an independent state were formed in each little valley,
none of them would be large enough to be of any importance in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
Greece: but at the same time some sort of separate government
in each valley was natural in a country where communications
were so much interrupted by mountains. It is said that they
lived for a time under a single government only&mdash;the kingly
government of the descendants of their hero Orestes: but at
some very early period each of the valleys must have acquired
some sort of independence, since, on the abolition of the kingly
government, at a time too early to be known to history, the
separate cantons or cities acted for themselves and voluntarily
joined together in a confederation, adopting at the same time
institutions of a popular character. They acquired such a
reputation for just government and good faith in their dealings
that after the battle of Leuctra in 371 <span class="small">B.C.</span> they were singled
out from all the Greek states to act as arbitrators, on some
points which were disputed, between the victorious Thebans
and the defeated Spartans: and Polybius believed they had
acted in the same capacity at a much earlier date in the affairs
of Croton and Sybaris, two states which had been founded in
southern Italy by colonists from Achaia<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a>. For centuries they
lived on, somewhat isolated from the rest of Greece and little
noticed by Greek writers, but maintaining their union and
their system of government. Even in the days of Philip of
Macedonia and his son Alexander the Great they were left
unmolested: but, after Alexander's death, some of the ambitious
princes who contended for power in Greece and Macedonia
contrived to sow discord among their cities: they were consequently
unable to defend themselves, and some of the cities
were occupied by Macedonian garrisons, while others were put
under the rule of tyrants. The gradual destruction of the
league which was thus brought about must, from what Polybius
says, have begun at some time after 315 <span class="small">B.C.</span> when Cassander
came to the throne of Macedonia, and have been completed in
thirty years from that date. The earlier part of the mischief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
was done by Cassander and Demetrius Poliorcetes, the rest by
Antigonus Gonatas son of Demetrius<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a>.</p>

<p>About the year 283 <span class="small">B.C.</span> it chanced that the attention of
Antigonus was called away from the affairs of Greece; and the
Achæans, being thus delivered from his interference, before
long began to restore their federal union. At first, about
280 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, the renewed league consisted of only four of the cities:
then it was joined by three more, and probably before long it
included all the rest:&mdash;the whole number being now reduced to
ten, for four had ceased to exist, and only two new ones had
grown up<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a>. For about thirty years the league did not include
any cities outside Achaia: but in 251 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Aratus of Sicyon,
when only twenty years of age, rescued his native city out of
the power of its tyrant by surprising the garrison, and, in order
to provide for its future safety, induced his fellow-citizens to
enrol their state as a member of the confederation. In the
year 245 <span class="small">B.C.</span> he was elected to the office of strategus or chief
magistrate of the league: and that office he held, as a general
rule, thenceforward in alternate years till his death thirty-two
years later. He was most active and skilful in bringing cities
into the league. In his second term of office he surprised and
overpowered the Macedonian garrison which held Acrocorinthus,
and thus set Corinth free. The liberated Corinthians were
glad to join the Achæans, and the league, gaining possession of
the Corinthian citadel which commanded the Isthmus, was able
thenceforth to protect not only its own cities but the whole
of the Peloponnesus against any enemy that came by land<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a>.
After this many other cities gave in their adhesion: the most
important of those that joined before 227 <span class="small">B.C.</span> were Megara,
Trœzen, Epidaurus, Cleonæ, Mantineia, Phlius, Megalopolis, and
Argos<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a>.</p>

<p>The league, throughout the period of its reconstitution in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
Achaia and its extension outside (that is to say from 280 <span class="small">B.C.</span> to
227 <span class="small">B.C.</span>), was most successful in protecting a number of Greek
states from Macedonian interference. But it was never joined
by Sparta nor by several other Peloponnesian cities: and about
the year 227 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Cleomenes III., one of the two kings of
Sparta, wishing at whatever cost to regain for the Spartans
their old predominance in the Peloponnesus, found that the
Achæan league was an obstacle to his designs: and, having first
made an alliance with the Ætolians, who might have put
impediments in his way, he became engaged in a war with the
Achæans, and, in the course of it, defeated them in three important
battles. Aratus and his countrymen in their distress
thought it necessary to ask the aid of Antigonus Dôsôn, who
was regent in Macedonia as guardian of his nephew the young
king: Antigonus readily granted their request, but required
them in return to allow him to place a Macedonian garrison in
the Acrocorinthus. He entered the Peloponnesus, and, in 222
or 221 <span class="small">B.C.</span> at Sellasia in the north-east corner of the Lacedæmonian
territory, the allied armies of Macedonia and Achaia
won a great victory and destroyed the power of Cleomenes<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a>:
but the Achæans found that, by re-admitting the Macedonian
power to the Peloponnesus, they had forfeited their independence
in regard to foreign policy, and must conform to the
wishes of their too powerful ally. The league continued to
exist "for another period of seventy-five years, retaining its
internal constitution, vastly increased in territorial extent, but,
in external affairs, with only a few short intervals, reduced
almost to the condition of a dependent ally, first of Macedonia
and then of Rome<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a>." From the year 146 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Achaia and
Macedonia were both included in the dominions of the Roman
republic.</p>

<p>We have now to examine the structure and constitution of
the league of cities or cantons<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a>, which, though it eventually
succumbed to Macedonia, had in happier days been distinguished
for sixty years of successful assertion of its indepen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>dence.
We will observe first the relation of each component
state to the central government, and then proceed to inquire
into the nature of the central government itself.</p>

<p>The component states were left free to manage their own
internal affairs, each holding its own assemblies, electing its
own magistrates, and making its own laws on all matters
except the few that were reserved to be settled by the central
government<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a>. It is probable that they might even choose their
own constitutions: but practically a state under a tyranny or a
close oligarchy or even a strong kingly power like that of
Cleomenes at Sparta, was excluded from membership in the
league because it could not allow its citizens to take part in
the general assemblies which I shall have to describe in
speaking of the central government. In course of time all the
cities adopted constitutions of a popular but moderate character,
and in the second century <span class="small">B.C.</span>, when the league included the
whole Peloponnesus, Polybius says that all the states employed
the same laws, weights, measures, and coinage, and were all
alike in their administrative, deliberative and judicial authorities,
so that the whole peninsula differed from a single city
only in not having all its inhabitants enclosed within a single
wall<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a>.</p>

<p>The central government consisted of two deliberative bodies,
the assembly and the council, and of an executive officer, the
strategus, with several subordinates: its business comprised
the conduct of all foreign affairs, and the management of the
armed forces.</p>

<p>The assembly or synod was attended by all citizens of any
city in the league who chose to present themselves<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a>: its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
business was to settle questions of foreign policy and to elect
the executive officers of the league. The regular place of
meeting was Ægium, a small city on the Corinthian gulf, and
it seems that the assembly always met there till 218 <span class="small">B.C.</span>:
afterwards it sometimes came together at other cities in the
territory of the league<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a>. There were ordinary meetings every
spring and every autumn<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a>: and special meetings could at any
time be summoned by the magistrates to settle important and
urgent questions of foreign policy, the duration of any special
meeting being limited to three days<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a>. The votes on questions
of policy were taken not by heads but by states: that is to say,
each state had one vote, and its vote was given Aye or No,
according as the majority of those of its citizens who were
present inclined to the one side or the other<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a>.</p>

<p>Of the council almost nothing is known: its meetings were
held not only at the times of the federal assemblies, but at
other times also: for in the year 220 <span class="small">B.C.</span> king Philip had an
interview with the council at Ægium about a question of
foreign policy, which he would certainly have laid before the
assembly if it had been possible<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a>. The number of members
in the council must have been at least a hundred and twenty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
and may have been larger<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a>. From the little evidence that
we have we may perhaps gather that the council sat for a
good part of the year, and acted as a committee of the assembly
to prepare the business that had to be laid before it: and, at
times when the assembly was not sitting, decided any questions
that were not so important as to necessitate a special meeting
of the assembly.</p>

<p>The executive officers were the strategus, and ten demiurgi
or ministers:&mdash;together with a hypo-strategus or under-general
and perhaps a secretary of state<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a>. The strategus was elected
each year in the spring meeting of the assembly and entered on
his duties a short time after his election. His office was in its
origin military, and he was by right commander in the field
and controller of the armed forces: but his most important
functions were to act as leader in the assembly&mdash;to expound his
foreign policy and obtain authority to carry it out&mdash;and to
manage negotiations with foreign powers: this last part of his
work was of such moment that the symbol of his office was
a seal<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a>. It is shown by the case of Aratus that the Achæans
were more anxious that their strategus should be a good foreign
minister than that he should be a good commander-in-chief:
for though Aratus was a very poor general and lost many
battles, his countrymen set such a value on his skill in dealing
with foreign affairs that they elected him over and over again&mdash;not
indeed in successive years, for the constitution forbade
it&mdash;but as often as the law allowed.</p>

<p>The ten demiurgi were also elected by the assembly<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
They acted collectively as presiding officers in the assembly and
determined what questions should be put to the vote<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a>: but
they also acted as a cabinet or council of ministers to the
strategus; for on one occasion a despatch was addressed by
Flamininus the Roman general to the strategus and the
demiurgi, and the reply to it was written in the name of the
same authorities<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a>.</p>

<p>The federal government of the league, which has just been
described, is called by Polybius a democracy: but it was not a
democracy according to the definition which Aristotle gave in
stating his classification of polities; for he defined democracy as
the rule of the many for the interest of the poor<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a>. In the
Achæan league it can hardly be said that the many were the
rulers: for, though no citizen was excluded by law from the
assembly, the attendance was in practice limited to those who
had time and money to spend in travelling to the place of
meeting, and to those few who chanced to reside there. Moreover
the meetings were held so seldom and lasted for so short a
time that the assembly could not control the government in
regard to details, and, though of course it had the supreme
power in great questions and in the last resort, it practically
left nearly everything in the hands of the strategus. Finally
the policy of the league was conducted in the interest not of
any governing class or governing person but of the community
at large.</p>

<p>A Polity or Commonwealth was originally defined by Aristotle
as the rule of the mass of the citizens for the advantage
of the whole community: and he afterwards described it as a
mixture of oligarchy and democracy. Hence it is clear that,
on the lines of his classification, the Achæan league was a
Polity. The supreme power in it belonged in one sense to the
whole of the citizens, because no citizen was legally excluded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
from the assembly, and thus the constitution had one of the
characteristics of democracy: but in another sense power belonged
to those only of the citizens who possessed a fair income
and could actually attend the meetings, and in this respect the
constitution was oligarchic. Moreover, though oligarchy and
democracy when unmixed both belong to the perverted polities,
because their governments rule selfishly, the mixture of them
in the Achæan league produced a normal polity, viz., a Polity
or Commonwealth, whose governors ruled for the good of the
whole people. But these were not the only elements in the
constitution: the aristocratic principle was conspicuously
present, and was seen in the great power and commanding
influence which Aratus possessed in consequence of his high
qualifications as a ruler and adviser.</p>

<p>The federal system of government combined many advantages.
It enabled the Greeks to continue to live as members of
small self-governing communities&mdash;a way of living to which the
physical features of their country naturally led them, and to
which they were deeply attached: it gave them, through
their union, much greater security than they could have
enjoyed without it: and it formed a large part of them into a
community that more resembled a nation than anything else
that had yet arisen in Greece. The system was tried not only
by the Achæans but also by several other divisions of the
Hellenic race: by the Phocians, the Acarnanians, the Epirots,
the Arcadians, and the Ætolians<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a>: and among the Ætolians and
Acarnanians it attained such a measure of success that in the
later period of the Macedonian supremacy these two peoples
were, after the Achæans, the most important of the Hellenic
powers.</p>

 It may be objected that the Goths from about 250 <span class="small">A.D.</span> were living close
to the Greeks, and the Old Germans from about 50 <span class="small">B.C.</span> had the Romans as
their neighbours, and possibly learned the art of ploughing from these neighbours
and borrowed a name for it. It seems enough, however, to answer that if the
Goths had taken a word from ἀρόειν they would have chosen something more

 Especially the scene of the death of Hector in the twenty-second book of
the Iliad. Achilles having driven all the Trojans except Hector within their
walls, pursued Hector thrice round the city, in the sight of the Trojans on the
walls and of the host of the Greeks assembled on the plain outside the city.
If any part of the city had been outside the wall, it must have been mentioned
as impeding or aiding the flight of Hector, or as having been captured by the
Greeks. As it is, the poet has no landmark outside the city to show how far
the chase had extended except a fountain where the two springs, one hot and
one cold, of the Scamander, had been built round with stone platforms on
which clothing was washed by the Trojan women.</p></div>

 Plutarch, <cite>Lycurgus</cite>, 6. The document, being in prose and not ambiguous,
bears no resemblance to the genuine utterances of the Delphic priestess; and
therefore I think not only that it is not an oracle really delivered to Lycurgus
but also that it was not composed while the oracle of Delphi was active and the
character of its utterances well known: that is to say, before 450 <span class="small">B.C.</span> or 400 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
I imagine it to be the work of some antiquarian, who knew the Doric dialect
extremely well: such a man might no doubt be found at Alexandria during or

 Tyrtæus, Fragment 4. As the conquest of Messenia is a rare if not a
unique example in Greece after the purely legendary age of a permanent
conquest effected in spite of the obstacles interposed by a mountain range, it is
worth while to take notice of the geography. The Spartans certainly did not
cross Taygetus, whose lowest pass, now known as the Langada Pass, is about
five thousand feet above the sea (Neuman und Partsch, <cite>Physikalische Geographie
von Griechenland</cite>, p. 181 note): to the north of Taygetus they could cross without
any trouble from the valley of the Eurotas to the valley of the Alpheius (see
the page just referred to): but before they could reach Messenia they still had
to march three or four miles up a valley with mountains on either side of it
and then to cross a barren sparsely wooded ridge which unites Taygetus with
Mount Lycæus. The ascent of the ridge takes an ordinary traveller half an
hour, so that the height of it will be about five or six hundred feet. See
Bædeker's <cite>Greece</cite>, p. 283.</p></div>

 Plutarch (<cite>Aristides</cite>, 22) says that Aristides proposed to the assembly a
resolution that the archonship should be thrown open to all Athenian citizens:
and he seems to imply that the resolution was passed, and that thenceforth
any Athenian citizen, whether he was a Pentacosiomedimnus, a Hippeus, a
Zeugites, or a Thês, was legally qualified to hold the office. It is however
certain that no such extensive change in the constitution was made in the
lifetime of Aristides: for Aristides died about 468 <span class="small">B.C.</span> (see Clinton, <cite>Fasti
Hellenici</cite> under the years 469, 468, 429), and Aristotle, in his <cite>Constitution
of Athens</cite>, chapter 26, tells us that it was not till 457 <span class="small">B.C.</span> that the Zeugitæ
were admitted to the archonship. If then Aristides carried any resolution that
altered the law, it did not go beyond throwing open the office to the Hippeis or
Horsemen. The Thêtes or Labourers were never formally declared eligible:
but in Aristotle's time there was nothing to prevent a Thês from becoming
an archon, provided that on announcing his candidature he did not declare that
he belonged to the class of Thêtes. Aristotle, <cite>Constitution of Athens</cite>, chapter 7.</p></div>

 Most of the communities in Achaia and some of those in Arcadia were
rather cantons than cities: Plutarch (<cite>Aratus</cite>, ch. 9) calls the Achæans <span lang="grc">μικροπολῖται</span>,
citizens of petty towns. Corinth, Argos and Megalopolis were great
cities.</p></div>

<span lang="la">(omnibus fere populis ... præ se ferentibus quid decreturi essent)</span>: then the citizens
of Dymê and Megalopolis and some from the Argolid left the assembly: but
(<span class="small">XXXII.</span> 23) the rest of the <em>states</em> of the league, when asked in turn how they

the councillors (see Polybius <span class="small">XXIII.</span> 7 in Dindorf's edition: <span class="small">XXII.</span> 10 in
